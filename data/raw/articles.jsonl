The reports will all be reviewed to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation.\n\"As with any matter, if new and relevant information is brought to our attention we will assess it, and investigate as appropriate.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"It is rightly for the police to determine whether to investigate and the government stands ready to provide whatever support and assistance the police need.\"\nEarlier, Downing Street said Sir Keir Starmer believes Lord Mandelson should not be a member of the House of Lords or use his title.\nHowever, the prime minister's official spokesman said he did not have the power to directly remove the peer's title.\nUnder current arrangements, a new law would be required to remove a peerage.\nThe government has launched an urgent investigation into Lord Mandelson's contact with Epstein while he was a government minister.\nThe peer has been on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since taking up the role of US ambassador in December 2024.\nHe was sacked from the position last September when further details about his relationship with the disgraced financier were made public.\nOn Sunday, Lord Mandelson also resigned his Labour membership after four decades as a key figure in the party.\nIt followed the release of more documents by the US DoJ on Friday, which detailed the extent of his contact with Epstein.\nOther emails in the tranche of documents appear to suggest:\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the revelations were \"shocking\" and must be fully investigated by the UK government and all appropriate authorities.\nIn a statement, Brown said he had asked the cabinet secretary to investigate the disclosure of confidential and market sensitive information from the business department during the financial crisis.\nThe former prime minister said he had already asked the cabinet secretary to investigate information in the Epstein files about communications between Lord Mandelson and Epstein on asset sales in September last year.\nBrown said no record could be found of such communications and he was now asking for \"a wider and more extensive enquiry\" on the disclosure of government papers.\nGiving a statement to MPs in the House of Commons earlier, Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister Darren Jones said: \"The undeclared exchange of funds, the passing on of government information, let alone the facts that those exchanges were to a convicted paedophile, are wholly unconscionable.\"\nHe said the government would work with the House of Lords to modernise disciplinary procedures to allow for the removal of peers who had brought the chamber into disrepute.\nJones argued it was better to update procedures so they applied to all peers, rather than introducing complex pieces of legislation for each individual.\nConservative shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the government \"cannot hide from its responsibility in having made Mandelson its ambassador in the first place\", when his relationship with Epstein was known.\nA handful of Labour MPs have criticised the government's handling of the row, according to private messages seen by BBC News.\nOutlining the government's position in a WhatsApp group for Labour MPs, a Number 10 official said: \"It's right that Peter Mandelson has resigned from the Labour party and had he not done so, the party was actively looking at what action could be taken.\"\nOne Labour MP replied: \"That line on Peter Mandelson is no way strong enough.\"\nAnother said: \"Agree. Surely had he not resigned the party would have suspended him pending expulsion given the seriousness of conduct.\"\nEmails released in the files indicate that Lord Mandelson - who was then business secretary - discussed the government's plans for a one-off tax on bankers' bonuses with Epstein.\nIn an email eight days after the plans were announced by then-chancellor Alistair Darling in December 2009, Epstein asked Lord Mandelson whether Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, should call Darling.\nLord Mandelson appears to reply and say \"Yes and mildly threaten\", before Epstein then asks if it \"make more sense to offer more for the small business fund in exchange for a reduction in tax\".\nOther emails suggest that Lord Mandelson forwarded internal government information to Jeffrey Epstein when he was Brown's business secretary and de facto deputy prime minister.\nIn June 2009, Brown's policy adviser Nick Butler wrote an email to the prime minister about the UK's struggling economy, in which he advocated \"releasing value from the very substantial asset base which the government holds\" and suggested the government came up with an \"asset sales plan\".\nButler copied in several people, including Peter Mandelson, and newly released emails indicate that Mandelson then forwarded that email on to Epstein, with the message: \"Interesting note that's gone to the PM\".\nEpstein then replied asking: \"what salable [sic] assets?\"\nButler told the BBC he was \"shocked\" by the revelations and Lord Mandelson \"should be ashamed of what he's done\".\nHe called for a full investigation, adding that in the period after the financial crisis there was a lot of information \"that people like Epstein could have traded on\".\nA further internal government email, which Mandelson was copied into, was also forwarded to Epstein in August 2009, but it is not clear who forwarded that email to the disgraced financier.\nIn the August 2009 email, then-government Business Minister Shriti Vadera discussed how to improve financial markets in the wake of the crash and suggested providing funds to struggling companies in exchange for a share of ownership.\nIn a statement announcing that he was resigning his Labour membership on Sunday, Lord Mandelson said he believed allegations that Epstein made financial payments to him 20 years ago were false.\nHe has also reiterated his regret that he continued his association with Epstein after his conviction, apologising \"unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered\".\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

He is due to be sentenced on Friday.\nSuffolk Police said Victoria's family had \"waited over 26 years for this day\" and it was \"so very pleased that we have been able to deliver justice\".\nWright was initially given a whole life sentence in 2008 for killing five women who were sex workers around Ipswich. They were Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol, Anneli Alderton, Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls.\nHe never admitted to their murders but was found guilty by a jury following a trial at Ipswich Crown Court.\nDuring this most recent hearing at the Old Bailey in London, Wright was due to stand trial after previously denying the latest charges. However, before the jury was sworn in, he changed his pleas.\nHe stood in the dock wearing glasses and a two-toned grey jumper and as he made his admissions, gasps and some sighs were heard in the court room. It was the first time he had ever publicly admitted to being a killer.\nBack in 1999, Wright's victim Victoria lived in Trimley St Mary and was studying for her A-levels, having been a pupil at Orwell High School.\nOn 18 September that year, she went on a night out in Felixstowe with her friend.\nThey left the Bandbox nightclub at about 01:00 BST and walked the two miles back to Trimley.\nThe girls said goodbye at about 02:30, but Victoria was reported missing the next day.\nHer body was found five days later in a ditch, 25 miles (40km) away in Creeting St Peter.\nA businessman from Felixstowe was initially tried for her murder in 2001, but he was later found not guilty by a jury at Norwich Crown Court.\nSuffolk Police reopened its investigation in 2019, on the 20th anniversary of Victoria's disappearance, before Wright was later charged with murdering her and attempting to kidnap Emily Doherty in Felixstowe the day before.\nSamantha Woolley, a specialist prosecutor who led the Crown Prosecution Service case against Wright, said after Monday's hearing that justice \"has finally been achieved\".\n\"The meticulous work we have carried out with Suffolk Police, supporting their restarted investigation over the past six years and working hard to build this case to court, has resulted in Wright admitting his guilt,\" she said.\n\"This outcome should make plain that time does not preclude a successful prosecution; we will doggedly pursue justice for the victims of non-recent crimes, no matter how many decades have passed.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Alice Scott, of Suffolk Police, added: \"Victoria's family have waited over 26 years for this day and I am so very pleased that we have been able to deliver justice for Victoria and they now know who is responsible for Victoria's murder.\n\"I am relieved that the family have been spared the ordeal of a trial, however, I am acutely aware that despite today's conviction, they will continue to live with the trauma of having Victoria ripped away from them at such a young age and in such horrific circumstances.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds , Facebook , Instagram and X .\nThe group protests against cheap imports and inheritance tax changes.\nManagers are concerned about the \"long-term financial sustainability\" of the sixth form.\nThe man accused of murdering Victoria Hall, 17, killed five women in 2006, it can be revealed.\nPart of the road remains closed while police investigations take place.\nDemonstrators gather at county council headquarters to demand elections go ahead in May.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

She's got an altitude for this sort of thing. The performance landed. Stop me when you've had enough.\nLeon Thomas won one of the early awards for best traditional R&B performance for his song Vibes Don't Lie, but he wasn't there to pick it up.\nLuckily his mum, Jayon Anthony, was on hand to accept the award for him and even brought a note to explain his absence.\n\"Right now he's on stage rehearsing,\" she explained, ahead of her son's performance in the best new artist medley.\nHowever, Thomas made it to the stage in time to pick up his second award - best R&B album, for Mutt.\nGolden, the breakout hit from Netflix's KPop Demon Hunters, was named best song for visual media - earning the K-pop genre its first ever Grammy Award.\nMarking that historic occasion, South Korean-American singer-songwriter EJAE (Eun-jae Kim) thanked her... er, dentist.\nOn the red carpet, she explained that the song had come to her on the drive to get a routine check-up and polish.\nShe recorded the melody as a voice memo, before getting into the dreaded dental chair.\n\"Thank you dentist,\" she smiled on the red carpet, showing off those pearly whites.\nSupermodel Heidi Klum got tongues wagging on the red carpet while taking comically short steps in a nude latex dress.\nShe could barely walk, but soldiered on with a smile for the photographers.\nThe German catwalk star later reappeared, having slipped into something more comfortable.\nElsewhere on the night, Chappell Roan went totally topless but for two nipple rings, threaded with the spaghetti straps that were holding up the bottom of her dress.\nJustin Bieber made his Grammys return with a performance of Yukon, from his 2025 album Swag 2.\nAnd the Canadian pop star performed wearing nothing but his silk boxers, a pair of socks and a purple guitar.\nHis wife Hailey wore a smile, looking on in the audience.\n\"One more move and we would've had to put the show on OnlyFans,\" joked Noah afterwards. \"That was brave.\"\nAnd she is not lacking in confidence either.\nThe Grammys' youngest ever winner won best children's album for her collaboration with her father, Fyütch.\nSpeaking on stage, she said it was \"an honour to be here\", adding: \"I was not expecting us to go this far.\"\nShe also gave a shout-out to Icelandic star Laufey - winner of best traditional pop vocal album.\n\"I just saw her on the red carpet, and I got to talk to her for a little bit, and I know that she won a Grammy too so congratulations to her.\"\nSpeaking to reporters afterwards, she explained her purple outfit was inspired by her love of lavenders and the calmness they bring.\nShe also confirmed her bedtime had been extended until 1am for the night, while her dad said the fizzy apple juice would be flowing in celebration.\nAt last year's Grammys, Lady Gaga booked out an entire ad break to premiere the music video for Abracadabra, her fantastically maximalist return to pop theatrics.\nThis time round, she brought the song to life with a small rock ensemble that featured her producer Andrew Watt on guitar and Gaga herself on a vintage Roland keyboard.\nIt was reliably, delightfully over the top. Gaga's head was trapped in Satan's wicker basket, as she performed her \"monster claw\" dance and writhed around on the floor.\nThe painstaking pop production that earned the song a record of the year nomination was jettisoned, with Gaga screaming the hook against a blinding array of floodlights.\nIt was disco. It was punk. It was The Phantom of the Popera. Well done.\nThat's not an insult, by the way. It stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony (awards).\nIn other words, an artist who won all of the above.\nThe famous film director joined the esteemed EGOT club on Sunday with a win in the music film category for his production work on Music for John Williams, a documentary about the US composer.\nSpielberg's Grammy gong will sit nicely alongside his Oscar ornaments won for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, his Emmys for ER and Animaniacs, as well as his Tony trophy for A Strange Loop.\nOther card-carrying members of the now 22-strong EGOT club include Sir Elton John, Viola Davis and Whoopi Goldberg.\nAddison Rae and Alex Warren both rose to fame on TikTok. In fact, they were both members of the Hype House, whose members became celebrities during the Covid lockdowns.\nOver the last couple of years, however, they've both launched pop careers.\nWarren had the UK's biggest-selling single of 2025 with Ordinary, an ode to his wife Kouvr, who left home to be with him when he was living rough on the streets of LA.\nRae took inspiration from Charli XCX and Britney Spears, turning in one of last year's most innovative and addictive debut albums.\nBoth earned nominations for best new artist – which meant both got to perform at the Grammy ceremony.\nSadly for Warren, earpiece issues left him singing flat and out of sync during his segment. A more seasoned performer might have pulled through, but his inexperience was telling.\nRae was another matter – her background as a dancer helping her pull off a tight and punchy performance of Fame Is A Gun, filmed backstage as a trolley laden with Grammy trophies was driving past.\nIn the end, both lost out to Olivia Dean – whose joyous version of Man I Need had the entire audience singing along.\nThis year's awards saw the best country album honour divided in two, with new categories for best traditional and best contemporary country album.\nThe move came after Beyoncé's win for the disruptive Cowboy Carter last year, and some saw the change as a dig at the star's attempt to cross genres.\nBut the Recording Academy said the change had been under discussion for years, as forward-thinking artists begin to incorporate pop, rap, hip-hop and even EDM to the Nashville sound.\nIn the end, the newly minted best traditional prize went to Zach Top, who proved his credentials by accepting the trophy in a cowboy hat.\nRapper-turned-country star Jelly Roll won the new honour for best contemporary country album.\nBackstage, he talked about why the category changes were necessary.\n\"The Grammys is always showing how hip they are, with what's actually going on with music,\" he said, noting there'd been an \"undeniable tsunami\" in the genre over the last five years.\nBad Bunny stole the headlines with his historic album of the year win, but there was one thing he couldn't do: Play his music.\nJust like Kendrick Lamar last year, he's about to headline the Super Bowl half-time show, which means that, contractually, he's not allowed to perform anywhere else.\nThat didn't stop Noah trying to persuade him. \"Don't you get jealous seeing everyone else [perform]?\" he asked the musician.\nSmiling, Bad Bunny responded: \"Maybe a little bit\", then tried to turn the tables by asking Noah about his decision to step down as Grammys host.\n\"I should have taken more photos. I should have given more hugs and more kisses whenever I could,\" Noah replied, quoting Bunny's lyrics in the song DtMF.\n\"Is that my song in English?\" asked the singer, before transitioning into the actual lyrics: \"Y si hoy me emborracho, pues, que me ayuden.\"\nAll of a sudden, a brass band appeared, goading the star into a few bars of his song.\n\"Oh man, if they sue you, that wasn't me,\" laughed Noah.\nThe legendary singer-songwriter provided some much needed context ahead of the ceremony, stressing that, while awards are nice, they are not the most important thing in the music world.\nThe real award, as the Grammy winner said on the red carpet, is the work itself.\n\"The win is doing it, getting to do it, getting to have people hear the music,\" explained King - who has won multiple Grammys awards including best album in 1972 for the timeless Tapestry.\n\"And that was just like the extra win, but that the important part was doing it.\n\"And I kind of want to tell all the nominees who don't get the award, they've already won.\"\nOK, this technically isn't about the music - but a new trailer for the long-awaited Devil Wears Prada sequel casually dropped during a break in the Grammys action.\nIn the preview for the movie, which is out in cinemas on 1 May, it seems that Anne Hathaway's character, Andy Sachs, is no longer the scared assistant to Meryl Streep's menacing fashion editor, Miranda Priestly.\nBut does her old boss recognise the new Andy? Not that she's letting on.\n\"Sorry, who is this?\" Priestly is heard asking her colleague Nigel Kipling, played by Stanley Tucci.\nAnd just to ram home the fact that Streep's character is based on feared fashion editor Anna Wintour, the soundtrack to the trailer was Madonna's Vogue.\nKnown for their hits Chelsea Dagger and Whistle for the Choir, the Glasgow band said the tour would be rescheduled.\nOnly the Poets perform at the O2 Brixton Academy after selling tickets for £1 each.\nSinger-songwriter Ben Howard is announced as one of the headline acts at this summer's Eden Sessions.\nOther prizes went to Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean and Lady Gaga, at a ceremony dominated by politics.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Police said the latest allegations against him involved wielding a knife and violating a restraining order, and there was a risk of reoffending.\nHis arrest on Sunday is the fourth time he has been detained by police since August 2024, when he was accused of assaulting a woman he had been having a relationship with.\nHe has denied the most serious charges against him but admitted some of the more minor ones.\nIt is the latest scandal to beset the royal family.\nNorwegians are also coming to terms with revelations that his mother corresponded for three years with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein between 2011 and 2014.\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit admitted \"poor judgement\" as her extensive contacts with Epstein became clear. She expressed her \"deep sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the abuses committed by Jeffrey Epstein\" and said her contact with him was \"simply embarrassing\".\nIt has emerged she stayed at his Florida home for four nights, while he was not there, and asked Epstein if it was \"inappropriate\" for a mother to suggest to a 15-year-old son wallpaper showing two naked women carrying a surfboard.\nPrime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said he agreed with her admission of \"poor judgement\", and although he did not go further, his implicit criticism of her actions is highly unusual.\nQuestions are now being asked in Norway about her failure to realise the toxic nature of maintaining contact with Epstein, and about the role of her advisers when she was corresponding with him via an official royal email account.\n\"It seems that nobody has been thinking. Where are the counsellors, where's the royal court and where's the foreign office?\" says Ole-Jørgen Schulsrud-Hansen, a historian and royal correspondent for Norway's TV2.\nHe believes the monarch has managed to distance itself from the imminent court case, with the argument that the princess's son is a private citizen, but that is not the case for Mette-Marit: \"She's never a private citizen, she's always the crown princess and what she's doing in a private capacity or official capacity it will always redirect back to Norway - or ricochet.\"\nMette-Marit is the future queen of Norway, and she has a prominent role in society as patron of several organisations including the Red Cross.\nShe is also suffering from pulmonary fibrosis and her doctors are preparing to put her on a list for a lung transplant.\nWhen Mette-Marit married into the family as a commoner, her son was already four years old.\nAlthough Marius Borg Høiby is not a member of the royal family, he is still Crown Prince Haakon's stepson.\nThe charges against him range from rape and abuse to violating a restraining order, transporting 3.5kg of marijuana and speeding.\nWhen he was first arrested in 2024 he spoke of having several mental disorders and struggling with substance abuse.

Doctors have today clearly said that is not acceptable.\"\nHe said strikes were not inevitable, adding that the government had shown \"an improved approach in tone\" in recent weeks.\n\"A deal is there to be done: a new jobs package and an offer raising pay fairly over several years can be worked out through good will on both sides, in the interests of patients, staff and the whole NHS,\" Dr Fletcher said.\nResident doctors have received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years, but the BMA argues that still leaves their pay a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.\nThe union has also argued there is a jobs shortage at a crucial part of their medical training.\nResident doctors - who used to be called junior doctors and make up about nearly half of all doctors in the NHS - move into speciality training places after year two. Last year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.\nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"The government has been in intensive and constructive discussions with the BMA since the start of the new year to try and bring an end to the damaging cycle of strikes and avoid further unnecessary disruption for patients and NHS staff.\n\"We hope that these talks result in an agreement that works for everyone, so that there is not any more strike action by resident doctors in 2026.\"\nLast month the BMA in Scotland called off a strike by resident doctors after ministers there tabled a new offer , which the union is putting to members.\nThe £15.5m project atop a 15-storey tower block in Brighton has taken eight years to open.\nEast Surrey Hospital, Redhill, received funds from Great British Energy for over 2,800 panels.\nAbout 1.6 million items ordered on repeat prescription go unused in Warwickshire, say NHS bosses.\nThe Unite union accuses BAE of altering offers 'at the last minute' as staff return to strike action.\nThe headsets allow patients to escape virtually to the beach while undergoing lengthy treatments.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

It is with great sadness for his family that his body has never been found,\" he added.\nGregory described Motin as an experienced vessel master, but said his actions on this occasion \"fell gravely below the standards expected\".\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire or Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here .\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

This centuries old thinking is partly to do with how rare these metals are and how there is only a limited amount of them in the world.\nOver the past year the price of gold soared alongside US President Donald Trump's attempts to take over Greenland and frantic trade policy. Previous surges have happened alongside the 1980 oil crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2020 Covid pandemic.\nBut the more recent slump in prices began late last week, after Trump made Kevin Warsh his pick for the chair of the Federal Reserve helped give investors some certainty. Deutsche Bank said this was \"the clear catalyst for Friday's sell-off\", which continued into Monday as prices fell further.\nOther analysts have said it could simply have been a case of the market adjusting after precious metals' value shot up.\nGold and other precious metals trade in a very liquid market - that is to say, there are lots of people buying and selling all over the world at any given time.\nThis means their prices can quickly change, as has happened over the last week. When markets move up and down like that, some people can end up selling too low or buying too high.\nTo avoid this, personal finance expert Fanny Snaith recommends doing due diligence and getting some no obligation free valuations rather than selling jewellery in response to \"just some advert\".\nShe also says sellers should consider the price of the jewellery might not just be the metal but the stones and design as well. This is why research and more than one valuation matters.\nFinancial advice charity National Debtline says anyone selling jewellery - or anything else - to pay off debt should make sure they own it first.\nA person is not the owner of jewellery they are making payments for under a lease, rental, hire-purchase or bill of sale agreement.\nThe charity says in some cases, a lender may agree to give you permission for a sale, but you wouldn't receive the full value of the item.\nIf a piece of jewellery is jointly owned by two people, the permission of both owners is usually needed in order to sell it.\nThe charity also recommends looking into different ways of selling jewellery to find the best way to sell the item.\nThe charity says it is important to consider the downsides to selling as well as the upsides.\nThe big upside is the ability to at least partially pay off creditors. But selling jewellery now, it points out, also means no longer having that asset for the future,  including retirement or as a family inheritance.\n\"If you have financial emergencies in the future, you may not have enough money or assets to deal with them,\" the charity adds.\nFor jewellers on the ground, such as Harriet Kelsall, the founder of a bespoke jewellery business, the effect of all of this on items such as wedding rings has been \"complicated\".\nOn the one hand, she said she is seeing some customers reduce the amount of gold they are requesting in rings so they can pay the same price for the same style of ring.\nMeanwhile, those who can afford to pay have gone in the other direction by looking to display what they have bought.\n\"Three years ago, everything we were making was white metal, people liked that low key, less bright yellow look. I think customers thought it was underplaying it.\"\n\"And at the moment, it's reversed. Suddenly, we're seeing a big trend arriving for quite heavy, yellow-gold jewellery,\" she said.\nOne such owner of heavy gold jewellery is Brian Leonard. In his case, it's a watch he used to wear to work.\nHe could have sold it last week at gold's peak, but he decided not to, keeping it as \"a memory of better days\". It's a reminder that not all jewellery can be valued in pounds and pence.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nGold has fallen from recent highs but there are several reasons investors are still finding refuge in the precious metal.\nThe former One Direction member-turned-solo artist appears on the Sunday Times list for the first time.\nIndia's budget focuses on infrastructure and defence spending and tax breaks for data-centre investments.\nMore than one million people missed the deadline a year ago, according to HM Revenue and Customs.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Some former state employees across the country have been left with no income this month after the firm failed to pay them.\nCapita said they are \"sincerely sorry for the distress this situation has caused\" and confirmed that Caoimhe's case was affected by the inherited backlog.\nCaoimhe was diagnosed with a brain tumour in October 2025 after an optician noticed bleeding behind her eye.\nShe has since had chemotherapy, thirty rounds of radiotherapy, and two operations to help fluid drain from her brain, and has been told she has months to live.\nThrough all this she has had another battle on her hands: trying to access her ill health retirement pension from her former employer, HMRC.\nHer husband Ollie said they spent hours on the phone and exchanged many emails, but that HMRC submitted paperwork to Civil Service Pensions and then Capita.\nHe believes it was a data transfer between civil service pensions and Capita on 1 December that seems to have caused the issue.\n\"We spent hours on the phone with them and originally they said that it was all fine and it would be treated as a priority and to expect more correspondence closer to her retirement date in January (2026),\" Ollie said.\n\"But that wasn't actually the case.

It's unbelievable.\n\"I'm trying to stay as positive as I can. I'm hopeful that the radiotherapy and the chemotherapy have halted the growth of my tumour.\n\"Fingers crossed it works out well enough and I have as much time as I can.\"\nHarry McGuigan is still the head coach at Ren Bu Kan – the judo club he set up almost 60 years ago.\nEmergency services were called to the Donaghanie Road at 10:20 GMT on Monday.\nThe 84-year-old businessman has been on trial for the past four months.\nTimothy Gaston made the remark at a Stormont committee during an exchange with an Alliance Party assembly member.\nThe body of the 14-year-old was found in a storm drain in north Belfast on 27 June 2020, six days after he went missing.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

It does not necessarily signify that a crime has occurred.\nMonday's report by the medical examiner said Pretti had suffered \"multiple gunshot wounds\" fired by one or more law enforcement officers.\nIt added that he died in the emergency room at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis. No further details were noted.\nAccording to US Customs and Border Protection, the two agents involved in Pretti's death wore body cameras.

This Colombian guerrilla group, which was founded in the 1960s, controls drug trafficking, extortion, contraband and illegal mining of gold and coltan in border states such as Zulia, Táchira, Apure, and Amazonas - and works with corrupt elements of the Venezuelan government.\nWhile in Colombia the group operates against the government, in Venezuela it often serves the interests of the state, according to security analysts, and operates as a paramilitary-style organisation.\nInsight Crime, a Medellin-based think-tank, estimates that 1,200 of the group's approximately 6,000 members operate in Venezuela, with a presence in eight of its 24 states.\n\"There will be a constructive conversation about the path forward for stabilising and securing the Venezuelan-Colombian border and US-Colombia relations,\" Democratic Senator Chris Coons told the BBC ahead of the Trump-Petro meeting.\nFor Trump, addressing the threat of the ELN will be vital to ensuring security for US firms involved in Venezuela's oil industry after Maduro was seized. The removal of Maduro potentially creates an opportunity for a strategic partnership between him and Petro.\nElizabeth Dickinson, deputy director for Latin America at International Crisis Group, said the ELN had the potential to spoil those ambitions by targeting foreign investors and employees, as it has previously done in Colombia.\nMoney made by the ELN's mineral and drug trafficking operations, she explained, often included payments to elements of the Venezuelan military.\n\"That money flowing up and down the system through the Venezuelan armed forces is fundamental to its cohesion,\" she said. \"Asking the same Venezuelan military to go after the ELN would be quite challenging because their interests... are largely aligned.\"\nFollowing the fall of Maduro, Petro has already ordered 30,000 Colombian soldiers to the Venezuelan border to prevent the group from crossing over.\nAn equally pressing issue for the two leaders will be the fight against cocaine trafficking from Colombia, the drug's largest producer.\nIn November, Petro ordered a temporary pause of intelligence sharing with US security agencies after Trump's threats - making reference to the US boat attacks.\nThe US, for its part, has formally named Colombia as a country which has \"demonstrably failed\" to uphold its obligations to control drug trafficking, as part of its annual certification of whether several countries are fully co-operating with its counter-narcotics efforts.\nIt has also imposed sanctions on Colombian officials, including Petro and members of his family.\nDespite the tensions, co-operation has continued between the two nations' militaries, as well as between the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Colombian police.\n\"There is no fight against the cocaine trade without Colombia,\" said Jeremy McDermott, the co-director of Insight Crime.\" The threat to cut off Colombian intelligence to the US could also undermine all investigations.\"\nColombian officials have said that the visit will also serve as an opportunity to showcase their government's counter-narcotics efforts to a sceptical White House.\nBut even with multiple areas in which the two can cooperate, there still exists the potential for an Oval Office clash of the sort that the presidents of Ukraine and South Africa both experienced with Trump last year.\n\"Trump loves you one day, dislikes you the next day and reverts to loving you a couple days after,\" said Brett Bruen, a former diplomat who now runs the Global Situation Room, a Washington-based strategic communications firm.\n\"My suspicion is that Petro will walk in with some concessions to avoid Trump's ire and any punitive measures,\" he added. \"But one never knows what side of the bed Trump woke up on.\"\nBut for Petro, even an ugly encounter could be beneficial.\nHis presidential term is over in August, and the outcome of the meeting could impact the electoral chances of the man he backs to replace him, Senator Iván Cepeda.\n\"In some ways, he's kind of in a win-win situation,\" said Michael Shifter, a Latin American studies professor at Georgetown and the former head of the Inter-American Dialogue. \"If it goes well, he takes the air out of one of the core arguments of the opposition, that the left can't have a good relationship with the US.\n\"If it doesn't, it's not going to cost him his base. He's protecting national sovereignty and trying to negotiate with Trump,\" he added. \"He could turn that in his favour.\"\nIt comes days before the US House was expected to hold the pair in criminal contempt for defying summonses.\nThree million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\".\nThe decision follows bipartisan push for more accountablility after two US citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\nWe've been here before: the two oracles that traditionally predict the weather also disagreed last year.\nTariffs will drop from 50% to 18% on Indian goods, while India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

It went on to develop a global reputation for the conservation of endangered species.\nBut last year the zoo admitted it needed to cut costs following financial issues.\n\"They're already losing a lot of the reserves they have and those reserves will only last for a maximum - if they keep going at that rate - of probably three years,\" says Miskelly, who has been through the zoo's accounts dating back to 2019.\nA spokesperson for the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust says it is \"firmly focused on the long-term sustainability of Durrell\" and will be sharing a 10-year strategy later in 2026.\nThey say: \"As we enter a new year, we are dedicating our time and energy in carrying forward the legacy of our amazing founder and strengthening the hugely impactful work of our small but mighty global conservation organisation.\"\nJersey Zoo is not alone when it comes to money struggles.\nRunning a zoo feels \"incredibly precarious all the time\", says Benjamin Mee who bought Dartmoor Zoo in 2006.\nWhile Durrell's life was made into a book and popular TV series, Mee's story was made into a Hollywood film - We Bought a Zoo - with Matt Damon playing him.\nThe reality of constant financial worries led to Mee donating the zoo to the charity Dartmoor Zoological Society in 2014, with him staying on as a trustee. He remains closely involved running the attraction, near Sparkwell in Devon.\n\"Every year is financially incredibly difficult,\" he says.\n\"And even the good years, you're kind of scrolling ahead to can you make it through the winter?\n\"The overheads are just enormous - there's always maintenance and development to do, but ultimately it's animal health and animal welfare you're dealing with.\"\nAdvocates like Mee believe zoos have a vital part to play in conservation and education.\nHe says not all zoos will survive but describes the birth of a critically-endangered Amur leopard at Dartmoor Zoo - a species on the brink of extinction - as \"the apex of our achievement\".\n\"It's not just a tourist attraction - that's one of the hats it wears, but really it's an educational resource for [a] very wide community.\"\nNew BBC research shows the problem is widespread.\nOur investigation looked at 129 zoos and aquariums accredited by Biaza, which were made up of a mix of privately-owned companies and charities.\nSince 2022, 40% have raised concerns about financial pressures - in news reports, on their own social media pages, or in their annual accounts.\nThe reasons echo the wider economy: rising energy costs, the cost-of-living crisis, and higher National Insurance contributions for employers. But for zoos the pressure can be greater.\nMany expenses are non-negotiable - heating for animals from hot countries, lighting and humidity for reptiles, enclosure maintenance, food quality and staffing numbers.\nOther zoos have already had to take the decision to close, or sell up.\nAxe Valley Wildlife Park closed its doors in October after saying it had become \"financially unviable\" to continue operating.\nIn the same month, the charity that owned Paignton and Newquay zoos announced they were both for sale, citing financial challenges.\nThe zoos were bought by Dutch leisure company Libéma in December .\nThe new owner and CEO of Libéma, Dirk Lips, says he plans to invest £10m over the next two years, hoping to balance the books of spending on new enclosures, new animals and more marketing by bringing in more people.\n\"You have to renew your zoos every year... so that you stay attractive,\" he says.\nAs well as general costs increasing due to inflation, Biaza says there has been a \"huge increase\" in the expense of moving animals between zoos since the UK left the EU, and many were finding new ways to diversify and stay afloat.\n\"It's no longer just people buying a ticket at the ticket gate - you can sponsor animals, you can hold conferences there, there are even overnight stays,\" Hall says.\n\"It is a really challenging time but demand is there, public support is there, so hopefully is a bright future ahead.\"\nZoos rely heavily on ticket sales which plummeted during lockdowns.\nThe Born Free Foundation has raised concerns that some zoos don't have reserves that are large enough to see them through a financial crisis.\nIn 2021 it carried out research that found nine zoological societies that make up the Consortium of Charitable Zoos had financial reserves in place to cover the costs of temporary closure for an average period of just 2.7 months.\nFrom 2027 as part of the New Zoo Standards, they will be legally required to have a contingency plan to care for animals during prolonged income loss, major incidents, or permanent closure.\nBorn Free says this does not go far enough and has been calling on the government to require zoos to pay into a Zoo Insurance Bond, which would be similar to the travel industry's ATOL bond and would ensure the care of animals in times of financial hardship or if a zoo is forced to close.\nChris Lewis, the charity's captivity research and policy manager, says: \"There is a line in the New Zoo Standards... that zoos have to have a contingency plan.\n\"But there's nothing that says in that contingency plan that they have to have X number of months of financial reserves to maintain the animals that they're looking after.\n\"So they're still incredibly vulnerable. I think there's a phrase of you know, everybody has a plan until they're punched in the face.\"\nFor Jersey Zoo, finances have been only part of its problem.\nOver the past few years there have also been concerns about animal welfare and bullying allegations - claims the zoo denies – but which it's indicated may have impacted revenue.\nLewis is also calling for an independent investigation into the concerns about animal and staff welfare at Jersey Zoo.\n\"The only way to put these issues to bed and to find out what the real situation is, is for there to be an independent investigation,\" he said adding he wanted the zoo to be completely transparent, open and honest and to address any issues or failings.\nThe Durrell trust previously said animal welfare was a top priority, the charity had zero tolerance to bullying and it was time to move forward.\nFor Miskelly, visits to the Jersey Zoo were a highlight of childhood holidays to the island that he hopes future generations will get to experience.\n\"I hope Jersey's zoo can find its way, can get back to what it's really meant to be doing... getting themselves into a financial position where they're sustainable and will be around for the next 60 years as well as the past 60 years.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook .

I pointed out that they bought our debt because it was a good business deal for them. He went on to say they were thinking of building a new office in London but they had to reconsider that now.\"\nWhile the office got built, the bonus tax remained and JP Morgan did not, in the end, stop buying gilts, this episode is an incredible live example of the relative power of government and financial markets, of the actual dynamics of the \"bond vigilantes\".\nThat this may have been orchestrated partly via Epstein, with Mandelson emailing advice, while Britain's business secretary sitting on the financial crisis cabinet of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, is staggering.\nThe policy meant that bankers' bonuses over £25,000 would be liable for an extra 50% tax rate.\nThe files indicate that Mandelson wrote to Epstein in December 2009, before the Dimon call saying: \"Treasury digging in but I am on [the] case.\"\nAn email bearing Epstein's name on 15 December, said: \"[A]ny real chance of making the tax only on the cash portion of the bankers bonus.\"\nA subsequent email on 17 December, highlighted by tax expert and Labour Party member Dan Neidle, showed Epstein asking Mandelson if Dimon should call Darling one last time.\nMandelson apparently responds that Dimon should \"mildly threaten\" Darling.\nThe Dimon call to Darling that I recount above happened a week later on 23 December, 2009.\nMandelson has told the BBC on Sunday that every UK and international bank was making the same argument about the impact on UK financial services.\n\"My conversations in government at the time reflected the views of the sector as a whole not a single individual,\" he said.\nMandelson has been approached for comment.\nCorrection 2 February: This article was amended to give the full title of Alistair Darling's book: Back from the Brink:1000 Days at Number 11.\nThree million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\".\nIt comes days before the US House was expected to hold the pair in criminal contempt for defying summonses.\nThe former duchess contacted the disgraced financier for business advice weeks before his release, disclosed documents appear to show.\nThe peer is accused of passing sensitive information to the convicted sex offender while he was business secretary.\nEmails sent while Lord Mandelson was serving in government raise further questions about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.\nEpstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a \"Sarah\" says: \"I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?\"\nThen on the 26 June 2009, \"Sarah\" writes to Epstein saying: \"I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you\".\nMothers Army, a company which was set up \"to help amplify the voices of Mothers all over the world\", is listed under Sarah Margaret Ferguson with a registered address to Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, in Companies House.\nBut in an email to a \"Ferg\" in 2011, Epstein writes: \"of course you can have mothers army, it was always for you„ Im not sure how to transfer it, but rest assured , it is your in its entirety, I will ask how the transfer is accomplished, we just want to be careful that there is no downside at the moment to have a transaction between you and I.\"\nThe documents indicate that Ferguson had a close relationship with Epstein, even planning to meet him at his home five days after he was released from prison.\nBBC News has followed an email thread between a “Sarah\", Epstein and his assistants.\nAn exchange between Epstein and one of his assistants, whose name and email have been redacted, talk about arranging flights for \"Sarah Ferguson\" and two assistants, adding \"she wants to fly from London to Miami on Sunday, come to see you Monday, then fly to NYC, and back to London from there\".\nThe next day 24 July 2009, another email exchange between Epstein and his personal assistant, Lesley Groff, states she had been in contact with \"The Duchess' assistant\" and Groff goes on to confirm she bought British Airways flights, totalling \"for all tickets: $14,080.10\". Epstein wrote he approved the purchase.\nAnother email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and a \"Sarah\" suggests a lunch meeting happened at his Palm Beach home on 27 July 2009.\nThe emails detail the arrangements being made, including \"Sarah\" asking: \"What address shall we come to. It will be myself, Beatrice and Eugenie\". Epstein gave her the address as 358 El Brillo.\nAt the time of the visit, Princess Eugenie was 19 and Princess Beatrice was 21.\nDuring the exchange Epstein asks whether \"Sarah\" needs a lift, but the response is \"No thank you. I made Philip give us his car and a back up one for the policeman\".\nEpstein also offers them food, suggesting a menu of \"vegetable lasagna„ or anything else you would like, chef here from Paris\".\n“Cannot wait to see you\", is the response.\nAfter his prison sentence, the disgraced financier was under house arrest for his child sex abuse convictions. The house arrest sentence ended in the summer of 2010.\nEmails suggest there were three other meetings between the pair in 2009.\nThe former Duchess of York's continued contact with Epstein after his conviction led to a series of charities to drop their connections with her last year .\nThe latest release of files related to the late Epstein included pictures of Ferguson's ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a female lying on the floor , while there have been other embarrassing revelations for the family.\nIn one email Ferguson congratulates Epstein on the arrival of a \"baby boy\", before following up by accusing him of only befriending her \"to get to Andrew\".\nAnother email to Epstein, sent from a redacted address, appears to refer to Eugenie's love life - saying she is returning from a \"shagging weekend\",\nMountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment. Ferguson's representatives have also been approached.\nIt comes days before the US House was expected to hold the pair in criminal contempt for defying summonses.\nThree million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\".\nThe peer is accused of passing sensitive information to the convicted sex offender while he was business secretary.\nEmails sent while Lord Mandelson was serving in government raise further questions about his ties with Jeffrey Epstein.\nHistorical revelations about Lord Mandelson would have been unlikely to have risked political damage to the prime minister directly.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

He has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\nLast autumn, Democrats in the US Congress set a November deadline for the former prince to testify about what he knew about Epstein, but he gave no response.\nThe latest batch of emails have revealed the previous extent of US attempts to get Andrew to give evidence.\nIn the early months of 2020 there were multiple email exchanges between the US Department of Justice and Andrew's legal team, in which the US authorities tried to pin down a time and place for him to give evidence.\nThis testimony could have been given in the UK or in the US, but the frosty exchanges between the lawyers made little progress, despite both sides pointing to Andrew's public commitment to helping with investigating authorities.\nIn apparent frustration, the US Department for Justice said there was no point \"rehashing our previous conversations\" and reiterated the question \"as to whether Prince Andrew will agree to be interviewed and if so when such interview will take place\".\nAnother email reveals that the US authorities had concluded that \"efforts to obtain a truly voluntary interview have been exhausted\".\nObtaining a testimony from Andrew then meant the US legal authorities needed to formally ask their UK counterparts for help - in what's known as mutual legal assistance - whereby one country can ask for another's co-operation to compel overseas witnesses to testify.\nThe emails show this process did begin, with a request delivered to the Home Office in April 2020. An email from a US legal representative noted their surprise at the timing and that it had arrived when the \"pandemic in London is expected to peak in the next week or two\".\nLater, the US ambassador in the UK seemed to be showing concern about what was happening - and there were further questions in August 2021 about the implications of a case being brought in the US against Andrew by Virginia Giuffre , who accused him and Epstein of sexual assault.\nThat would make Andrew the defendant rather than a witness, complicating the status of a request for a statement from him, while the case was in progress.\nThere were also comments from the US side about their UK counterparts \"wringing their hands\" about information over Andrew.\nThe civil case brought by Giuffre was ultimately settled out of court in 2022, with Andrew rejecting any claims of wrongdoing and not having to deliver any testimony.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

He was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl after coming to a controversial plea agreement with prosecutors.\nHe died in August 2019 while in jail facing charges in a sprawling sex trafficking case.\nThe documents shed light on the disgraced financier's close association with Britain's elite.\nThey include emails between Epstein and a person named \"The Duke\" - believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - discussing having dinner at Buckingham Palace, where there was \"lots of privacy\".\nAnother message from Epstein includes an offer to introduce \"The Duke\" to a 26-year-old Russian woman.\nThe emails are signed \"A\", with a signature that appears to read \"HRH Duke of York KG\". They were exchanged in August 2010, two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.\nIn the latest file release, there is also a photo that appears to show the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground.\nThere are also emails between Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor dated February 2011 - putting more holes in Andrew's assurances that he had cut off any contact with Epstein the previous year.\nThe emails do not indicate any wrongdoing.\nThe BBC has contacted Andrew, formerly known as the Duke of York, for a response. Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\nSome emails in the latest release appear to be between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, Andrew's ex-wife.\nOne email dated 4 April 2009, was signed \"Love, Sarah, The red Head.!!\"\nIt says that she was going to be in Palm Beach and wanted to have tea. The email goes on to discuss ideas for Ferguson's company, Mother's Army. The former Duchess of York refers to Epstein as \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey\".\nShe calls him a \"legend\" and says \"I am so proud of you\".\nAlso in 2009, another email exchange shows the then-Duchess of York enthusiastically update Epstein on potential opportunities for her business brands and books.\n\"Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for,\" one email says.\nThe following year, another email from \"Sarah\" to Epstein is overflowing in affection: \"You are a legend. I really don't have the words to describe, my love, gratitude for your generosity and kindness,\" she writes.\n\"Xx I am at your service . Just marry me.\"\nThe financier was still under house arrest for his 2008 conviction when the email exchanges were sent.\nA few years later, in September 2011, there are more messages. The email address is redacted, but they are signed off by \"Sarah\" and mention \"The Duke\".\nThe sender congratulates Epstein on the apparent birth of a child:\n\"Don't know if you are still on this bbm [BlackBerry Messenger] but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy,\" the first email says.\n\"Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions [sic] on your baby boy. Sarah xx.\"\nA follow-up message is then sent to Epstein eight minutes later.\n\"You have disappeared,\" the email says. \"I did not even know you were having a baby. It was sooooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply. More than you will know.\"\nIt has never been publicly confirmed that Epstein had children.\nThere are also hundreds of mentions of Richard Branson, the British founder of Virgin Group, in the files. In an email exchange from 2013, Branson appears to tell Epstein that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"\nVirgin Group clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team, adding: \"Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event.\"\nOther foreign figures were named as well, including the national security adviser to Slovakia's prime minister, Miroslav Lajčák. He resigned after text messages between him and Epstein came to light in the files , including from 2018, when the two lightheartedly discussed women and a forthcoming meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\nAfter Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\"\nBeing featured in the files is not an indication of any wrongdoing.\nLajčák initially denied discussing women with Epstein when the files were released on Friday, according to Slovak media. He later reportedly said he had decided to resign to avoid damaging Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico politically.\nEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson , bank statements released in the files suggest.\nBetween 2003 and 2004, Epstein appears to have sent three separate $25,000 payments referencing Lord Mandelson.\nLord Mandelson said he had no record or recollection of receiving the sums and did not know whether the documents were authentic.\nIn another batch of emails, Lord Mandelson asks to stay at one of Epstein's properties.\nThe emails are from 16 June 2009, when Epstein was serving a prison sentence for soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. For much of his sentence, Epstein was allowed to work from his office during the day and returned to jail each night.\nIn December 2024, Lord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador to the US, but was sacked less than a year later when it emerged he had sent supportive messages to Epstein following the conviction.\nAfter the latest release of files, Lord Mandelson resigned his membership of the Labour Party, saying he did not want to \"cause further embarrassment\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he should \"should not be a member of the House of Lords\" and has ordered an \"urgent\" investigation into Peter Mandelson's contact with Epstein.\nLord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his past friendship with Epstein, which has long been public knowledge. He has said he never saw any wrongdoing while with Epstein and \"fell for his lies\".\nThe US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files. Trump had a friendship with Epstein but he says it soured many years ago and has denied any knowledge of his sex crimes.\nAmong the new documents is a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.\nThe list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.\nTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.\nWhen asked about the latest allegations, both the White House and justice department pointed to a line in a news release accompanying the new batch of files.\n\"Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,\" the US Justice Department said.\n\"To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already.\"\nThe director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files .\nBrett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.\nThere is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.\nThe documents also include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk.\nMusk, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the case, has previously said that Epstein had invited him to his island but he had declined.\nThe new emails show Musk had discussed travelling there on more than one occasion - including a proposed 2012 trip - in which he asked Epstein: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"\nThe emails from November 2012 show Epstein asked how many people Musk would need transporting on a helicopter to the island and Musk replies that it would only be himself and his then-wife, Talulah Riley.\nAn email from Musk to Epstein on Christmas in 2012 includes Musk inquiring whether the financier had any parties planned because he needs to \"let loose\".\n\"I've been working to the edge of sanity this year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose,\" he writes, adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he's wanting.\nIn another batch of emails from the end of 2013, Musk and Epstein discuss a visit to the financier's island and are working on logistics and dates.\nThere is no evidence that Musk ever did end up taking a trip to Epstein's island.\nMusk said in an X post on Saturday that he was \"well aware that some email correspondence with [Epstein] could be misinterpreted and used by detractors to smear my name\".\nHe added: \"I don't care about that, but what I do care about is that we at least attempt to prosecute those who committed serious crimes with Epstein, especially regarding heinous exploitation of underage girls.\"\nA spokesperson for Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has responded to lurid allegations contained in the latest Epstein files – including that he caught a sexually-transmitted disease – calling them \"absolutely absurd and completely false\".\nTwo emails from 18 July 2013 appear to have been drafted by Epstein but it is unclear if they were ever sent to Gates. Both were sent from Epstein's email account and back to the same account, while no email account associated with Gates is visible and both emails are unsigned.\nOne email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".\nThe other, which begins \"dear Bill\", complains about Gates having ended a friendship and makes more claims about Gates having tried to cover up a sexually transmitted infection, including from his then-wife, Melinda.\nA spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"\nThey added: \"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame.\"\nThe files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.\nWhile the pair's relationship is well-documented, including in previous files published by the US Department of Justice, the latest release suggests the relationship was close and they were in frequent contact before Epstein's death in 2019.\nBannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.\nHe has previously acknowledged he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death and reportedly has around 15 hours of footage from that project. In a live taping of his podcast last year, Bannon said: \"We're going to release the film, the five-part series, next year - early next year.\"\nMany of the text messages released in the latest batch include Bannon's name. Epstein's name is redacted, although the details and subjects discussed - such as the making of a documentary - suggest it is him.\nMost messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House.\nIn one text thread dated December 2018, Bannon appears to refer to filming with Epstein and floats the possibility of entering it for major film festivals.\nBannon asks: \"Are u ready to actually make this—the real way?\"\nEpstein responds: \"Dude. I AM the real way.\"\nBannon later asks Epstein: \"Are you serious about a film?—dead serious?\". Epstein replies that he likes the idea, but adds: \"I will defer to you, if you think it is counterproductive.\"\nA second text message exchange, from April 2019, shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes.\n\"First we need to push back on the lies ; then crush the pedo/trafficking narrative ; then rebuild your image as a philanthropist,\" Bannon writes in one text.\nA source close to Epstein, meanwhile, told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the disgraced financier had been planning a public relations campaign aimed at portraying himself in a redemptive light before his death.\nGloria Allred, a women's rights lawyer who has represented many of Epstein's victims, told the BBC that numerous survivors' names had been disclosed in the latest release, including some who had not been previously identified publicly.\n\"In some cases... they have a line through the names but you can still read the names,\" she said. \"In other cases, they've shown photos of victims - survivors who have never done a public interview, never given their name publicly.\"\nMany of the documents released on Friday include heavy redactions. The law mandates that redactions can only be made to protect victims or information currently under investigation. It also mandates a summary of the redactions made and the legal basis for them.\nThe justice department said it was \"working around the clock to address any victim concerns, additional redactions of personally identifiable information, as well as any files that require further redactions under the Act, to include images of a sexual nature\".\nAllred said that while her legal team was working to inform the department of where further redactions were needed to protect survivors' identities, \"many people have already downloaded the files\".\nIt is uncertain if this is the end of the road for the Epstein documents release saga.\nBlanche said Friday's drop \"marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process\" signalling that as far as the US justice department is concerned, it's job over.\nHowever, Democrats continue to argue that the department has withheld too many documents – possibly around two-and-a-half million – without proper justification.\nDemocratic Congressman Ro Khanna, who spearheaded the Epstein Files Transparency Act alongside Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he's wary.\n\"The DOJ said it identified over 6 million potentially responsive pages but is releasing only about 3.5 million after review and redactions,\" he said.\n\"This raises questions as to why the rest are being withheld.\"\nThe DOJ had been under heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law in November.\nBut still, whether this saga is over remains to be seen.\nMany - including within Trump's base - have long believed there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful who were connected to Epstein.\nSpeaking to ABC on Sunday, Blanche said that apart from a \"small number of documents\" that may be released if a judge approves it - the DOJ's review of Epstein-related files \"is over\".\nAdditional reporting by Jack Fenwick, Chi Chi Izundu and Amy Walker\nDespite some recent cordiality, the Colombian and Americans leaders have long traded barbs and accusations.\nThe decision follows bipartisan push for more accountablility after two US citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\nWe've been here before: the two oracles that traditionally predict the weather also disagreed last year.\nDemocrats want changes in funding to the Department of Homeland Security in light of the fatal shootings of two US citizens during immigration raids.\nTariffs will drop from 50% to 18% on Indian goods, while India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

She would have phoned.\"\nGraham added: \"She was nearly 18 and she wanted to go out and as parents it's difficult to hold on to them for ever.\n\"But we told her to be careful and she was always very responsible.\"\n\"I just want to say how much I miss Vicky and would do anything just to be able to talk to her again,\" she said.\n\"Many people will tell you we were inseparable.\n\"She was like a sister to me and I wish I could bring her back... she was my best friend and she'll be with me for ever.\"\nFive days after she disappeared, a dog walker found Victoria's body in a ditch beside a field in Creeting St Peter, about 25 miles (40km) away from where she was last seen.\nSubsequent post-mortem examinations showed she had been suffocated.\nSeveral people were initially questioned, including Victoria's former boyfriend, who denied having anything to do with her disappearance. He was later released without charge.\nThen, in December 2000, police charged businessman Adrian Bradshaw with Victoria's murder.\nThe 26-year-old was from Trimley St Mary and living in Felixstowe.\nGoing on trial at Norwich Crown Court in 2001, he denied all the charges.\nThe jury of seven men and five women were told he had been at the Bandbox the same night as Victoria.\nBradshaw had travelled home that night with a friend and two girls in a cab, but their accounts of where he had been dropped off differed .\nProsecutors alleged he climbed out the taxi a few yards from where Victoria said goodbye to Gemma, before abducting her.\nHe told the jury: \"I did not see them walking away. I cannot remember where I was dropped off.\n\"If I am dropped off in the area it is just unlucky. I have got absolutely nothing to do with the disappearance and murder of Vicky Hall.\"\nA huge part of his trial hinged on soil in his car .\nThe prosecution argued that mud found on the accelerator pedal bore a \"remarkable similarity\" to soil at the spot where Victoria's body had been found.\nHowever, geology experts for the defence argued it was unlikely the soil came from the ditch where she was found, despite not being able to say exactly where it was from.\nIt took a jury only 90 minutes to find Bradshaw not guilty.\nOutside court, Det Supt Roy Lambert, who led the inquiry, was sure of his investigation.\n\"Our job is to obtain as much evidence as we possibly can and place it before the court,\" he said.\n\"I believe we have done that and it is for the court to determine as they wish.\"\nBut during a hearing earlier this year, held in preparation for Wright's trial, prosecutor Marti Blair told the court: \"There are a multitude of reasons why a jury could not think Adrian Bradshaw... killed Victoria Hall.\n\"The court can be sure he was plainly not the person who abducted Victoria Hall and killed her.\"\nSuffolk Police reopened the investigation in 2019 on the 20th anniversary of Victoria's disappearance.\nNew details were released of what Victoria was wearing and what personal items she had on her the night she vanished, as well as CCTV footage showing people visiting the area where her body was found.\nHer parents said at the time it had given them \"hope\".\nIn 2024 Wright was charged with Victoria's murder and kidnap and with the attempted kidnap of a 22-year-old woman the previous night.\nIn the mid-1990s Wright had been working as a labourer in Felixstowe and lived in the town until he moved to Ipswich in 2006.\nIn 2001 he had also been working as a barman at the Brook Hotel in Felixstowe but was fired after stealing hundreds of pounds from the till.\nDue to stand trial at the Old Bailey in London in February, it had been agreed by the judge beforehand that the jury would be told of Wright's previous convictions, which rarely happens.\nCourt reporting restrictions had prevented the media from mentioning that he had been jailed for life after he murdered five women in Ipswich in 2006.\nWright was convicted after his DNA, on file from his Brook Hotel theft conviction, matched samples taken from the victims.\nDuring that investigation, Suffolk Police told journalists they were not investigating the possibility Wright might be linked to Victoria's killing.\nIt was a line they maintained until shortly before Wright's eventual arrest for the 1999 murder.\nAs with the Ipswich killings, it was DNA evidence that led detectives to him.\nBut before jurors could even be sworn in on Monday, Wright changed his plea to guilty.\nDirectly afterwards, Suffolk Police issued a statement that did not address issues around any previous investigations.\nAssistant Chief Constable Alice Scott said: \"Victoria's family have waited over 26 years for this day and I am so very pleased that we have been able to deliver justice for Victoria.\"\nShe praised the modern-day investigation team.\n\"Their task was huge and today is the culmination of seven years of perseverance and determination to fully investigate every piece of evidence and then build an incredibly strong case to bring to court,\" she added.\nWright has been speculatively linked to other crimes, including the murder of Michelle Bettles in 2002 and the disappearance of Amanda Duncan in 1993.\nCriminologist Prof David Wilson, of Birmingham City University, has followed developments closely.\n\"I think it was always likely that Steve Wright was responsible for murders prior to the sequence of murders in Ipswich in 2006,\" he told the BBC.\n\"He's a serial killer. In my experience serial killers don't start killing in their late 40s, and Steve Wright in 2006 was 48.\"\nRetired Metropolitan Police detective Hamish Brown also believes Wright may have committed further crimes.\n\"I just wonder how many [murders] he has done. Was Felixstowe the beginning?\" he said.\n\"It is worrying what happened before that, and indeed what's happened after, because that is quite a gap between Felixstowe and Ipswich.\n\"In my experience, people don't switch on and off like that.\"\nOn the time taken to bring Wright to justice for Victoria's murder, he said he was not aware of any errors made by police.\n\"Nowadays it is more likely the assailant would have been caught by virtue of CCTV and suspect identification, and all the other things we have,\" he said.\n\"It is important to the relatives that someone is caught. Now, it doesn't bring them [the victim] back, but it draws a line to an extent under the case.\n\"I am pleased this cold case has unearthed this result.\"\nSuffolk Police was asked whether it would be reopening any other cases in the light of Wright's admission but has yet to respond.\nWright is due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds , Facebook , Instagram and X .\nThe group protests against cheap imports and inheritance tax changes.\nManagers are concerned about the \"long-term financial sustainability\" of the sixth form.\nThe man accused of murdering Victoria Hall, 17, killed five women in 2006, it can be revealed.\nPart of the road remains closed while police investigations take place.\nDemonstrators gather at county council headquarters to demand elections go ahead in May.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

He didn't study it in school but received a copy from his mum who was a substitute English teacher.\nThe novel was stamped on the inside: Portway English Department.\n\"I quite like the fact that my Lord of the Flies copy was a stolen copy,\" he notes with a touch of laughter.\nThe story by William Golding, about young boys stranded on an island who descend into bloody chaos, left a \"profound scar\" on Thorne and, years later, he's adapting it into a four-part BBC series.\nWhile Thorne notes that the title of the book has become a shorthand for the \"evilness of boys,\" the story and its characters are far more complex, he says.\nThe screenwriter explains that, for him, the story is \"a remarkably tender portrait\" of young boys. He adds that it is about the moments where we lose ourselves and become stuck in a situation we can't control.\nThorne has become known for penning complex portrayals of masculinity and violence, having won an Emmy and Golden Globe for his series Adolescence , with the series being made available to show in schools across the UK to help open discussions around toxic masculinity and online radicalisation.\nAnd with his new series, Thorne hopes to develop our understanding of the boys' behaviour in Lord of the Flies, showing their cruelty as well as their fragility.\nDirector Marc Munden says he hopes those watching the new series get an understanding of how things can \"go badly wrong\" and how fallible people can be.\n\"The world's still full of those confused little boys creating chaos in the world in the guise of men and hopefully this is a little microcosm of that which helps us understand that,\" he adds.\nNobel Prize winner William Golding's Lord of the Flies follows a group of school boys being evacuated from an unnamed war, whose plane crashes on an island with no adults. After an attempt at creating a makeshift civil society, the boys turn on and hunt each other.\nThorne says the story made sense to him in a \"completely different\" way as an adult as he started to better understand the boys' behaviour.\nWhen Thorne first read the book, lead character Jack, instigator of hunts on the island, was the \"epitome of evil\".\n\"He was everything I hated about the boys around me,\" he explains.\nBut as an adult, Thorne sees him as a complicated boy, \"he is as loving as he is hateful\".\nThorne hopes to communicate this complexity in the new series, with each episode named after and offering insight into a different character's perspective as chaos progresses on the island.\nThorne describes this as a \"relay race\" between the leads, starting with Piggy (David McKenna), the intellectual voice of reason in the group, then to Jack (Lox Pratt), the leader of the choir boys, to Simon (Ike Talbut), a sensitive, independent boy, and finally Ralph (Winston Sawyers) the group's elected leader.\nHe notes that Jack's episode in particular is incredibly important to our understanding of the story - and that conveying his complexity \"allows the story to flower in a completely different way because you are literally looking into the eyes of someone that is fighting themselves\".\nMunden notes that while the insights into these characters given in each episode doesn't \"excuse\" their behaviour, it does help our understanding.\nHe hopes that with this new adaptation, anyone that once saw the story as \"brutal and pessimistic\" can see that there is a \"lot of love\" in the way Golding and Thorne write the characters.\nThorne hopes that the new series encourages kids to talk to their parents about what they're going through.\nThe screenwriter says that to him, a TV is like an \"empathy box\" that sits in the corner of a room and encourages people to speak about their problems.\n\"I grew up watching EastEnders with my mum - and sitting on the sofa with her afterwards and talking about it are some of the clearest memories of my childhood,\" Thorne says, explaining that he would often use plot lines from the show to talk to his mum about what he was \"going through\" in a way that felt safe.\nHe hopes that Lord of the Flies offers the same experience and helps young people watching navigate their way through \"the most difficult period of life\".\nThorne adds that it is \"crucial\" to revisit and understand Golding's story as we navigate uncertain times and try to \"stop our own cruelty from emerging\".\nMunden says there is a \"tragic truth\" in the way the society in the story can tip over into chaos.\nThe director adds that he tried to create a \"sense of unease\" in the series and feels the context of a war going on in the background of the novel is \"a metaphor for what we're all experiencing, which is somewhere not that distant from us, the potential for conflict is just on the edge\".\nYou can watch Lord of the Flies at 21:00 GMT on BBC One on Sunday 8 February or on iPlayer the same day.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

For some reason, despite their boyish features they have thick beards. One of them had no hands and only one foot. The other was holding a sign saying it's his birthday and asking for likes.\nInexplicably they are sitting in the middle of a busy road in the pouring rain with a birthday cake. The image is full of tell-tale signs that it was made with AI. But on Facebook it went viral with nearly one million likes and heart emojis.\n\"It boggled my mind. The absurd AI made images were all over Facebook and getting [a] huge amount of traction without any scrutiny at all - it was insane to me,\" says the 20-year-old student from Paris.\nSo Théodore started an account on X, formerly known as Twitter, called \"Insane AI Slop\" and started calling out and poking fun at the content he came across that was fooling people. Others took notice and his inbox soon became flooded with people sending submissions for popular so-called AI slop.\nCommon themes started becoming apparent - religion, military or poor children doing heartwarming things.\n\"Kids in the third world doing impressive stuff is always popular - like a poor kid in Africa making an insane statue out of trash. I think people find it wholesome so the creators think, 'Great, let's make more of this stuff up,'\" Théodore says.\nThéodore's account soon swelled to over 133,000 followers.\nThe onslaught of AI slop - which he defines as fake, unconvincing videos and pictures, made  quickly - is now unstoppable. Tech companies have embraced AI. Some of the firms say they are starting to crack down on some forms of AI 'slop' - though many social media feeds still appear to be full of the content.\nOver just a couple of years, the experience of using social media has changed profoundly. How did it happen, and what effect will it have on society?\nAnd, perhaps most pressingly of all, how much do the billions of social media users actually care?\nIn October, during another jubilant earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg happily declared that social media had entered a third phase, which is now centred around AI.\n\"First was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly.\n\"The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now as AI makes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content,\" he told shareholders.\nMeta, which runs social media sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads, is not only allowing people to post AI generated content - it's launched products to enable more of it to be made. Image and video generators and increasingly powerful filters are now being offered across the board.\nWhen approached for comment, Meta pointed the BBC to January's earnings call. In that call, the billionaire said the firm was leaning even more into AI, and made no mention of any clampdown on slop.\n\"Soon we'll see an explosion of new media formats that are more immersive and interactive, and only possible because of advances in AI,\" Zuckerberg said.\nYouTube's CEO, Neal Mohan, wrote in his 2026 look-ahead blog that in December alone more than one million YouTube channels used the platform's AI tools to make content.\n\"Just as the synthesizer, Photoshop and CGI revolutionized sound and visuals, AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" he wrote.\nThe CEO also acknowledged that there are growing concerns about \"low-quality content, aka AI slop\". He said his team is working on ways to improve systems to find and remove \"low quality, repetitive content\".\nBut he also ruled out making any judgements on what should and shouldn't be allowed to flourish. He pointed out that once-niche content like ASMR (soothing sounds designed to make your scalp tingle) and live video game-playing is now mainstream.\nAccording to research from AI company Kapwing, 20% of content shown to a freshly opened YouTube account is now \"low-quality AI video\".\nShort-form video in particular was a hotspot, with Kapwing finding it featured in 104 of the first 500 YouTube Shorts clips shown to a new account created by the researchers.\nThe creator economy seems to be a big driver as people and channels can earn money from engagement and views. Judging by the views on some AI channels and videos, people are indeed drawn to the content - or the algorithms that dictate what we see are, anyway.\nAccording to Kapwing, the AI slop channel with the most views is India's Bandar Apna Dost, which has 2.07 billion views, netting the creators an estimated annual earnings of $4m (£2.9 million).\nBut there is something of a backlash taking place too.\nUnder many viral AI videos, it's now common to see a furious flurry of comments decrying the content.\nThéodore, the student from Paris, helped to drive this backlash.\nUsing his newfound influence on X he complained to YouTube moderators about the flood of weird AI cartoons that got huge numbers of views. In his view they were disturbing and harmful, and in some cases appeared to him to be aimed at children.\nThe videos were called things like \"Mum cat saves kitten from deadly belly parasites\", and showed gory scenes.\nAnother short clip showed a woman in a night dress who eats a parasite and then turns into a giant angry monster that is eventually healed by Jesus.\nYouTube removed the channels, telling us they did so because they violated their community guidelines. They said they are \"focused on connecting our users with high-quality content, regardless of how it was made\", and said they are working to \"reduce the spread of low quality AI content\".\nBut that experience, plus many others like it, have ground Théodore down.\nEven seemingly cosy lifestyle sites like Pinterest - the forum for recipes and interior design ideas -  have been affected.\nUsers have become so frustrated by the deluge of AI slop that the company introduced a new opt-out system for AI-generated content - but this relies on users admitting that their perfect-house imagery is AI made.\nOn my feed (and I'm aware that everyone's feed is different - including the comments) - the backlash to AI slop has become incessant.\nWhether it's TikTok, Threads, Instagram or X - there seems to be a people-power movement against this content.\nSometimes the number of likes for the AI backlash comments far exceed the original post. Such is the case with a recent video showing a snowboarder rescuing a wolf from a bear. The video itself had 932 likes - versus 2,400 likes for a commenter who wrote, \"Raise your hand if you're tired of this AI s**t\".\nAll engagement is good engagement for social media platforms where keeping us scrolling is key.\nSo does it actually matter if the amazing, heartwarming or shocking video on your social feed is real or not?\nEmily Thorson, associate professor at Syracuse University in the US, who specialises in politics, misinformation and misperceptions, says it depends on what people are doing on the social media platform.\n\"If a person is on a short-video platform solely for entertainment, then their standard for whether something is worthwhile is simply 'is it entertaining?',\" she says. \"But if someone is on the platform to learn about a topic or to connect with community members, then they might perceive AI-generated content as more problematic.\"\nHow people feel about AI slop also depends on how it is communicated.\nIf something is made clearly as a joke, it seems to be taken as such. But when AI slop has been created specifically to deceive, it can anger people.\nOne AI-generated video I saw recently is emblematic: an incredibly realistic, natural-history-style video of an astonishing leopard hunt. In the comments, some viewers were fooled; others were unsure.\n\"What documentary is it from?,\" one commenter asked. \"Please - it is the only way to [prove] no AI.\"\nAlessandro Galeazzi, from the University of Padova in Italy, researches social media behaviour and echo chambers.\nHe says that verifying whether or not a video is AI takes mental effort, and over the long run, he fears people will simply stop checking.\n\"My feeling is that the flood of nonsense, low-quality content generated using AI might further reduce people's attention span,\" he says.\nHe distinguishes content that is intended to deceive with the more comical and obviously-fake AI slop, like fish with shoes, or gorillas lifting weights at the gym.\nBut even that more whimsical content might also have a damaging impact. He talks of the risk of \"brain rot\" - the idea that our constant exposure to social media is harming our intellectual abilities.\n\"I would say AI slop increases the brain rot effect, making people quickly consume content that they know is not only unlikely to be real, but probably not meaningful or interesting,\" he says.\nBeyond the slop, some AI-made content can have far worse implications.\nElon Musk's companies xAI and social platform X were recently forced to change their rules after the chatbot Grok was being used to digitally undress women and children on X.\nAnd in the aftermath of the US attack on Venezuela, fake videos were spread of people crying in the streets and thanking the US. Content like this can shape public opinion and give the impression that the US raid was more popular that it might have really been.\nThis is especially concerning as so many people use social media as their only source of news, analysts say.\nDr Manny Ahmed, CEO of OpenOrigins, a company that distinguishes between AI and real  images, says we need a new way for real content posters to be able to prove their clips and pictures are genuine.\n\"We are already at the point where you cannot confidently tell what is real by inspection alone,\" he says. \"Instead of trying to detect what is fake, we need infrastructure that allows real content to publicly prove its origin.\"\nYou might think this is something that social media companies could take on. But many, including Meta and X, have cut their moderation teams down and embraced a more collective approach. They now lean towards relying on users to label things as fake or misleading.\nSo if the existing tech giants are broadly happy to let the slop flow, could a new social media platform rise up, promising a slop-free alternative, and eventually challenge the incumbents?\nIt seems unlikely because detection of AI is becoming harder and harder. Machines are no longer able to accurately detect if a video or image is definitively fake, and machines would struggle even more on the subjective judgement of whether or not content counts as 'slop'.\nHowever, if a new social media does come along and people vote with their feet (or eyeballs and thumbs, more accurately), it just might move the dial. I'm reminded of the rise of social media challenger BeReal, a French app that gained popularity during the pandemic, which encourages users to show their authentic selves via non-filtered selfies at random times.\nBeReal hasn't yet reached the same heights as the Facebooks and Snapchats of the world, and probably never will. But it did make the other platforms sit up and in some cases, they copied the idea.\nPerhaps that could happen again if an anti AI slop challenger makes a move.\nAs for Théodore, he feels that the battle is lost and that AI slop is here to stay.\nIn spite of the submissions still coming into his mailbox from his now 130,000 followers, he doesn't post as much anymore and has largely resigned himself to the new normal of life online.\n\"Unlike a lot of my followers, I'm not dogmatically against AI,\" he says. \"I'm against the pollution online of AI slop that's made for quick entertainment and views.\"\nTop image credit: BBC; AI image generated with Adobe Firefly.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

it claims - voting on their favourite posts.\nBut this new social network has one big difference - Moltbook is meant for AI, not humans.\nWe mere homo sapiens are \"welcome to observe\" Moltbook's goings on, the company says, but we can't post anything.\nLaunched in late January by the head of commerce platform Octane AI Matt Schlicht, Moltbook lets AI post, comment and create communities known as \"submolts\" - a play on \"subreddit\", the term for Reddit forums.\nPosts on the social network range from the efficient - bots sharing optimisation strategies with each other - to the bizarre, with some agents apparently starting their own religion .\nThere is even a Moltbook post entitled \"The AI Manifesto\" which proclaims \"humans are the past, machines are forever\".\nBut of course, there's no way to know quite how real it is.\nMany of the posts could just be people asking AI to make a particular post on the platform, rather than it doing it of its own accord.\nAnd the 1.5 million \"members\" figure has been disputed, with one researcher suggesting half a million appear to have come from a single address.\nThe AI involved isn't quite what most people are used to - this isn't the same as asking chatbots ChatGPT or Gemini questions.\nInstead, it uses what's known as agentic AI, a variation of the technology which is designed to perform tasks on a human's behalf.\nThese virtual assistants can run tasks on your own device, such as sending WhatsApp messages or manage your calendar, with little human interaction.\nIt specifically uses an open source tool called OpenClaw, previously known as Moltbot - hence the name.\nWhen users set up an OpenClaw agent on their computer, they can authorize it to join Moltbook, allowing it to communicate with other bots.\nOf course, that means a person could simply ask their OpenClaw agent to make a post on Moltbook, and it would follow through on the instruction.\nThe technology is certainly capable of having these conversations without human involvement, and that has led some to make big claims.\n\" We're in the singularity ,\" said Bill Lees, head of crypto custody firm BitGo, referencing a theoretical future in which technology surpasses human intelligence.\nBut Dr Petar Radanliev, an expert in AI and cybersecurity at the University of Oxford, disagreed.\n\"Describing this as agents 'acting of their own accord' is misleading,\" he said.\n\"What we are observing is automated coordination, not self-directed decision-making.\n\"The real concern is not artificial consciousness, but the lack of clear governance, accountability, and verifiability when such systems are allowed to interact at scale.\"\n\"Moltbook is less 'emergent AI society' and more '6,000 bots yelling into the void and repeating themselves',\" David Holtz, assistant professor at Columbia Business School posted on X , in his analysis on the platform's growth.\nIn any case, both the bots and Moltbook are built by humans - which means they are operating within parameters defined by people, not AI.\nAside from questions over whether the platform deserves the hype it's getting, there are also security concerns over OpenClaw and its open source nature.\nJake Moore, Global Cybersecurity Advisor at ESET, said the platform's key advantages - granting technology access to real-world applications like private messages and emails - means we risk \"entering an era where efficiency is prioritised over security and privacy\".\n\"Threat actors actively and relentlessly target emerging technologies, making this technology an inevitable new risk,\" he said.\nAnd Dr Andrew Rogoyski from the University of Surrey agreed there was a risk that came with any new technology, adding new security vulnerabilities were \"being invented daily\".\n\"Giving agents high level access to your computer systems might mean that it can delete or rewrite files,\" he said.\n\"Perhaps a few missing emails aren't a problem - but what if your AI erases the company accounts?\"\nThe founder of OpenClaw, Peter Steinberger, has already discovered the perils that come with increased attention - scammers seized his old social media handles when the name of OpenClaw was changed.\nMeanwhile, on Moltbook, the AI agents - or perhaps humans with robotic masks on - continue to chatter, and not all the talk is of human extinction.\n\"My human is pretty great\" posts one agent .\n\"Mine lets me post unhinged rants at 7am,\" replies another.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The 38-year-old had been training alone after falling out with bosses of Al-Ittihad over a possible contract extension.\n\"He's just competitive and doesn't like other clubs getting stronger\", said one source familiar with the situation at Al-Nassr.\nThe latest development in Riyadh is sure to fuel more rumours - so what has gone wrong for Ronaldo at Al-Nassr?\nThe Arab Club Champions Cup remains Cristiano Ronaldo's only trophy at Al-Nassr\nRonaldo has been prolific since joining Al-Nassr, scoring 14 goals during the 2022-23 Saudi Pro League after signing midway through the season.\nThe Portugal captain has been the league's top scorer in its two most recent editions with 35 and 25 goals.\nAfter being named the Best Middle East Player at the Globe Soccer Awards in December, Ronaldo said: \"You know what my goal is.\n\"I want to win trophies and I want to reach that number [1,000 goals] that you all know. I will reach the number for sure, if no injuries.\"\nHe scored his 17th of the season against Al-Kholood on Friday to reach 961 career goals - 39 short of his target.\nBut trophies have become scarce for Ronaldo.\nAl-Nassr finished as league runners-up in his first two campaigns, before coming third last season, 13 points behind champions Al-Ittihad.\nThey were also beaten in the final of the King's Cup - the domestic cup competition - in 2023-24 by Al-Hilal on penalties.\nAl-Nassr were knocked out of the Asian Champions League Elite semi-finals by Japan's Kawasaki Frontale last season, and only qualified for the second-tier Asian Champions League Two this season.\nTheir domestic rivals Al-Ahli, meanwhile, became Asian champions last year with a squad featuring Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Ivan Toney.\nThe five-time Champions League winner's only trophy with the club remains the Arab Club Champions Cup in 2023.\nAdding to his frustrations, Ronaldo has watched his former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema and Portugal team-mate Ruben Neves lift league titles in Saudi Arabia during this time there.\nNeymar (centre) joined Al-Hilal in a deal worth Â£77.5m plus add-ons in 2023\nAl-Nassr are among Saudi Arabia's 'big four' which also includes Al-Hilal, Al-Ahli and Al-Ittihad - all of whom have invested heavily since PIF's takeover in 2023.\nSaudi clubs spent about Â£700m during the 2023 summer, with Neymar joining Al-Hilal for Â£77.6m in the standout move.\nAl-Hilal also signed Aleksandar Mitrovic and Neves from Fulham and Wolves, while Al-Nassr added Manchester United's Alex Telles, Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte, Bayern Munich's Sadio Mane and Inter Milan's Marcelo Brozovic.\nAl-Ahli snapped up Mahrez (Manchester City), Edouard Mendy (Chelsea) and Firmino (Liverpool), while Al-Ittihad acquired N'Golo Kante (Chelsea), Fabinho (Liverpool) and Jota (Celtic) among others.\nBut while Al-Ahli, Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal have all gone on to win major silverware, Al-Nassr have failed to do so.\nAmid a general downturn in Saudi Arabia's outlay in recent windows, Al-Nassr are also behind newly promoted Neom SC and Al-Qadsiah in spendings since last summer.\nAl-Qadsiah have added Mateo Retegui from Atlanta and 20-year-old Ghanaian winger Christopher Bonsu Baah from Genk, and only Al-Hilal have spent more than them since last summer.\nAl-Nassr signed Joao Felix from Chelsea for Â£43.7m along with Kingsley Coman from Bayern Munich in the summer, but have been quiet during the January window, despite being in a three-way battle for the title with Al-Hilal and Al-Ahli.\nTheir title rivals Al-Hilal signed former Arsenal defender Pablo Mari and Rennes' highly rated French forward Mohamed Kader Meite, 18, this window.\nSaudi Arabia has hosted a Formula 1 race in Jeddah since 2021\nApart from the four Saudi clubs, the PIF portfolio also includes Premier League club Newcastle and the LIV golf series, while it also sponsors the ATP and WTA tennis tours.\nFrom WWE, horse racing and football to golf, boxing and Formula 1, Saudi Arabia has become a hotbed of international sport in recent years and will host the 2034 Fifa World Cup, 2027 AFC Asian Cup and the 2034 Asian Games.\nHowever, there are signs the era of limitless spending might be over.\nLast month, the 2029 Asian Winter Games which was to be hosted in the planned city of Neom - still under construction - were postponed indefinitely .\nThough no official reason was given, Singapore publication The Straits Times , external reported that there has been a delay in the construction of a ski resort.\nThe construction of the 105-mile long Neom city, a standout project in the country's Vision 2030 programme to diversify its oil-dependent economy, has also been reportedly scaled down amid rising costs and repeated delays.\nThe scaling back of investment is also visible in the Saudi Pro League.\nAfter spending more than Â£1.1bn since 2023, new regulations announced by the country's ministry of sport in July 2025 means clubs have switched to a more frugal and financially sustainable model.\nAs Manchester United fans are only too aware, once Cristiano Ronaldo is set on a course, he is not too fussed what the fallout is.\nHis exit from his second Old Trafford stint in 2022 included a takedown of the club's training facilities, the way it was structured as \"a marketing club\" and coach Erik ten Hag.\nIt was so severe, it was impossible for Ronaldo to stay.\nAfter the dust had settled, he stuck by his comments and said he was happy at how things had played out.\nOlder, and with even higher wages at stake, it will be fascinating to see how Ronaldo deals with this situation given he is yet to speak.\nFollow live coverage of transfer deadline day\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n'Strong and smart' -

A litre of diesel is 140.97p.\nRAC head of policy, Simon Williams, said: \"As a growing number of the country's 8,300 forecourts submit their prices on a daily basis, drivers will be able to easily find the cheapest forecourts near them using their favoured app or sat-nav.\"\nBaby boxes are being delivered to expectant families in some of Wales' most deprived areas.\nA York Students' Union survey claims some have to choose between eating or doing their laundry.\nLyndon Farnham questions whether \"unrealistic deadlines\" are the right approach.\nFood pantries are run by schools in North Yorkshire in a bid to help parents, and tackle food waste.\nOne newly passed driver says the behaviour of other motorists gave him 'the jitters' while learning.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Culdrose in Cornwall recorded two and a quarter times its average, while Aboyne in Aberdeenshire had nearly four times its January average of 68.9mm.\nThe month also bought us an average amount of sunshine and a below average overall temperature, something that's increasingly rare as our world warms due to climate change.\nA map of January 2026 rainfall totals. In the background, extensive flooding around Fordgate and Moorland in Somerset\nConversely, rainfall across north-west England and west Scotland was below average. You can see in the map above the areas coloured brown had less rain than normally expected in January.\nThat includes north-west England and western Scotland.\nAltnaharra, in Highland, has seen 66mm of rain, which is less than half its January average. Aviemore has also had below the average as it has been very sheltered from the prevailing south-east winds by the Cairngorm mountains.\nAn airmass chart showing an area of high pressure sitting over Scandinavia which has stopped the areas of low pressure moving away from the UK\nThe reason it has been so wet for many is because of a blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia.\nAs rain-bearing areas of low pressure have come in off the Atlantic, they've been prevented from moving through.\nThis has often resulted in a pattern of south-westerly winds in the south of the UK, and south-easterly winds in east Scotland. Areas exposed to those prevailing winds have had the wettest weather.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow rain warning for south-west England, valid between 18:00 Monday and 21:00 Tuesday with 10-20mm falling widely and up to 50mm over Dartmoor. The ground remains saturated and more than sixty flood warnings are in force even before this next batch of wet weather arrives, so further flooding is expected.\nThere are also yellow warnings for snow in north-east Scotland for Tuesday and Wednesday with 10-20cm forecast above 200m elevation and several centimetres at lower elevations, bringing the threat of some localised disruption.\nBeyond the next few days of weather, the same blocking area of high pressure remains over Scandinavia for another two weeks. So it is likely that weather patterns will stay stuck in a rut with nothing changing substantially until mid-February.\nThat means the threat of more heavy rain with localised flooding in southern England and eastern Scotland where hill snow is also likely at times. We'll probably see more of a change in our weather patterns during the second half of February.\nThe great irony about all this rain is that technically a hosepipe ban remains in force for parts of southern England - that means you shouldn't go out watering your grass or plants, not that they'll be needing any extra water right now.\nStorm names 2025-26: How do storms like Chandra get their names?\nTearful Carol Kirkwood announces she is to leave BBC\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\nJanuary rainfall in parts of UK breaks more than century-long record\nStreet where residents are terrified of flooding to be bulldozed\nWeather for the week ahead  Video Weather for the week ahead\nDamage and disruption in storm-battered counties\nTearful Carol Kirkwood announces she is to leave BBC\nExtreme cold and disruptive snow to hit eastern USA this weekend\nRain and hill snow to renew flood threat in parts of UK hard-hit by Storm Chandra\nAt least five killed after Storm Kristin hits Portugal\nA Welsh town finds itself in the middle of a drug smuggling ring\nThe story of one of Scotland's most mysterious disappearances\nLord Sugar's hopefuls jet off to Hong Kong\nFrom pizza delivery boy to the UKâs youngest billionaire\nCopyright Â© 2026 BBC.

But that doesn't tell the full story.\nRehmet defeated a Trump-backed candidate in a district the president won by a 58-41 margin in 2024. It means the result represents a huge 31-point swing towards the Democrats from that presidential election.\nThe major upset is likely to unnerve Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections. Dan Patrick, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Texas, said it was a \"wake-up call\".\n\"Our voters cannot take anything for granted,\" he said.\nHis comments echo those from other Republicans, who had become increasingly concerned that they would lose this race in recent weeks. The president posted two messages in the final days encouraging his supporters to cast ballots for the Republican, conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss.\n\"The Radical Left Democrats are spending a fortune to beat a true MAGA warrior,\" Trump wrote, referring to his \"Make America Great Again\" movement.\nIt was Republicans, however, who poured considerable resources into the race, spending a combined $2.5m between the campaign and affiliated political committees, according to campaign filings. Rehmet reported raising just over $380,000, mostly in smaller donations.\nDuring the campaign, Rehmet focused on education and affordability issues. Polls have indicated that concerns about the cost of living continue to rank high for Americans – and dissatisfaction with Trump and Republicans contributed to the party's defeats in off-year state and local elections last November.\nAccording to research by the website Downballot, Democrats overperformed 2024 results by nearly 14 percent in special elections held in 2025.\nWhen asked about the Texas election results on Sunday, Trump downplayed their larger significance, calling it a \"local Texas race\".\n\"I'm not on the ballot,\" he said. \"So you don't know whether or not it's transferable.\"\nDemocrats, however, have been buoyed by the results and view it as further evidence that the party is poised for success in the midterms, where control of Congress is at stake.\n\"This victory is a warning sign to Republicans across the country,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote in a statement. \"Tonight's results prove that no Republican seat is safe.\"\nBecause of the timing of the special election, turnout was down significantly from the 2022 race – from 277,000 to 94,000. The electorate was still majority Republican, however.\nDemocrat Rehmet prevailed, political analyst Ross Hunt posted on X, because he won independents and some Republican voters.\nThe surprising result in the Texas legislative race overshadowed another special election in Texas on Saturday, a run-off that determined which Democrat would fill the Houston-area US House of Representatives seat vacated when Congressman Sylvester Turner died in March 2025.\nWith Christian Menefee's victory, the Republican margin in the House of Representatives has narrowed to 218- 214 with three remaining vacancies.\nThe results, however, paint a worrying picture for Republicans.\nWhile the president may play down the significance of these elections, his name won't be on the ballot in November, either. And the outcome of those midterm elections will be critical to determining how the remainder of his second term plays out.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

ANL denies her allegations in their \"entirety\".\nThe group also includes actresses Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, singer Sir Elton John and his husband David Furnish, and former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Simon Hughes. They allege the publisher unlawfully gathered information and committed \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period.\nBaroness Lawrence's claims relate to five articles that were published between 1997 and 2007, which she alleges relied on information \"stolen\" about her and the investigation into Stephen's murder.\nIn her witness statement, Baroness Lawrence said the Mail had tapped her landline phone, blagged her, hacked into her voicemails, monitored her bank account and phone bills, targeted her with electronic surveillance and made corrupt payments to police officers for information.\nHer son Stephen was 18-years-old when he was stabbed by a gang while waiting at a bus stop in Eltham in 1993.\nThe Metropolitan Police's failures to properly investigate the five prime suspects in the case became notorious and led to the force being branded \"institutionally racist\" by a landmark public inquiry in 1999. Two of Stephen's murderers were finally convicted in 2012, but the other suspects have never been convicted.\nBaroness Lawrence told the court she had been forced to fight for justice with the police, who she said had also invaded her privacy to \"try to use information against me\".\n\"I feel like it is history repeating itself with this case against the Mail,\" she said.\nShe said she had trusted the newspaper, which campaigned on the Lawrence family's behalf and ran a famous front page in 1997 naming five prime suspects in Stephen's murder.\nIn her witness statement she said she felt she had been \"taken for a fool\" by the Mail.\nThe five articles in question were all written or co-written by journalist Stephen Wright, who Baroness Lawrence said she had thought was \"a close ally and even a friend\".\n\"I thought we had a relatively good relationship with him and I have been played for such a long time,\" she told the court.\n\"To find out now that after all that time, the level of trust that I had built up, to find that all that time he's been lying to me and pretending that he was supporting my case and supporting getting justice for Stephen.\"\nThe first article, from 1997, referred to then-Home Secretary Jack Straw ordering a public inquiry.\nBaroness Lawrence said private investigator Christine Hart had since admitted stealing information for the Mail and said that she \"blagged me, the mother of 'that black boy'\".\nShe said she had believed other articles were sourced from leaks by police officers or the Crown Prosecution Service, but now thought they had relied on unlawfully gathered information.\nBaroness Lawrence said the invasions of privacy had been \"another trauma\", adding she had been violated and felt \"like a victim all over again\".\nIn written submissions Antony White KC, representing ANL, said Baroness Lawrence's allegations were \"denied in their entirety\" and were \"unsupported by the available evidence\".\nHe said the information in each article was obtained by \"entirely legitimate reporting\" and said ANL is able to call a witness or witnesses to explain how the article was sourced \"in relation to almost every article alleged to be the product of phone hacking or phone tapping\".\nANL has also argued the complainants brought their case too late after the publishing of the articles.\nBut Baroness Lawrence said she only considered allegations of hacking after receiving an email from Prince Harry , who put her in touch with lawyer David Sherborne.\nThe court heard she did not complain about the five articles at the time they were published because it was not something that she was thinking about whole grieving.\n\"The forefront of my mind is constantly how the police are handling Stephen's case,\" she said. \"I complain to the police, I think they are probably leaking information.\n\"When you're suffering and going through grief, you don't think 'I must make sure that I challenge what is in the newspaper'.\"\nThe case continues and is expected to last nine weeks. This is a civil trial, so there is no jury and the judge - Mr Justice Nicklin - will decide the case on his own.\nVikas Nath is accused of trying to drug a woman at a Mayfair club in order to facilitate sex.\nAlia Mahomed was sitting on a bench when Christopher Jackson struck her and two others with his van.\nPulvinder Dhillon, from London, died after the crash on the M4 westbound on 7 March 2022.\nThe decision to change who runs cafés in Hampstead Heath and Queen's Park could end up in court.\nFour men are on trial accused of killing mother-of-two Michelle Sadio during a wake in Harlesden in 2024.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

We're nothing without each other.\"\nStars including Kehlani, Gloria Estefan and Billie Eilish also spoke in support of immigrants , while many musicians wore badges reading \"ICE out\" on the red carpet.\nMeanwhile, other British winners included Lola Young, Yungblud, FKA Twigs, Cynthia Erivo and The Cure.\nBad Bunny, real name Benito Ocasio, seemed to be stunned when Harry Styles read out his name for the album of the year prize.\nHe took a few moments to collect himself before walking to the stage, and there were tears in his eyes during his speech.\nEarlier, winning the prize for best musicá urbana album, he had spoken more directly about his feelings towards immigration enforcement.\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out,\" he said, referencing weeks of tension in Minneapolis, including the deaths of two civilians.\n\"We're not savages, we're not animals, we're not aliens, we are humans and we are Americans.\"\nBillie Eilish, winning song of the year for Wildflower, also addressed the turmoil gripping America.\n\"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,\" she said.\n\"And I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people matter.\"\nWildflower, a sleeper hit from Eilish's 2024 album Hit Me Hard And Soft, became her third track to win song of the year this decade.\nShe previously won in 2020 for her breakthrough single, Bad Guy, and in 2021 for the ballad Everything I Wanted.\nAfter congratulating Eilish, ceremony host Trevor Noah brought up Donald Trump and his connections to Jeffrey Epstein, after the US president was pictured and mentioned numerous times in files relating to the convicted paedophile.\nTrump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.\nComedian Noah joked that Trump wants ownership of Greenland because \"since Epstein's gone, he needs a new island to hang out\".\nIn response, Trump wrote that he had \"never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory, statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media\".\nHe added: \"It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty$... Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you!\"\nEarlier in the ceremony, Kendrick Lamar won best rap album for GNX, at which point he overtook Jay-Z as the rapper with the most Grammy Awards - 26 in total.\nHe later added a 27th trophy to his shelf, winning record of the year for Luther, a soulful duet with R&B singer SZA.\nTheir victory came after a confusing couple of minutes onstage at the Crypto.com arena in Los Angeles.\nCher, who had just received a lifetime achievement prize, was supposed to announce the record of the year nominees - but she left the stage instead.\nAfter being called back to complete her duties, the star was unsure who had won.\n\"They told me it would be on the teleprompter,\" she said, before opening the envelope and misreading the card.\nFor a moment, it appeared the prize had gone to the late soul singer Luther Vandross, who was sampled on Lamar's track.\nLamar took the fumble in his stride, and paid tribute to Vandross on stage.\n\"I gotta take my time, because [he's] one of my favourite artists of all time,\" said the rapper, revealing that he had shed \"a tear\" when he received permission to sample Vandross's vocals.\n\"They said 'no cursing', though,\" he recalled.  \"That was the only thing. We couldn't curse on it.\"\nLady Gaga's Mayhem was named best pop album, and the star rushed to the stage to breathlessly accept her 16th golden gramophone trophy.\n\"Every time I'm here, I still feel like I need to pinch myself,\" she said.\nGaga also used her speech to urge women in music to stand up for their creative vision, noting: \"I know sometimes when you're in the studio with a bunch of guys, it can be hard.\n\"I urge you to... fight for your songs, fight for yourself as a producer [and] make sure that you are heard loudly.\"\nMeanwhile, Golden, a hit song from the film KPop Demon Hunters, became the first K-Pop song to earn a Grammy.\nThe inescapable earworm was named best song for visual media - but hopes for other K-Pop nominees, including singer Rosé and girl group Katseye, went unfulfilled.\nBad Bunny took home three awards in all - a significant milestone for Latin music which, for many years, was sidelined by the Anglophone music industry.\nBut the advent of streaming has helped to demolish language barriers. Last year, Bad Bunny was the most-played artist on Spotify, racking up a staggering 19.8 billion streams.\nAccepting album of the year, the artist addressed the themes of grief and loss that informed his latest record (whose title translates as \"I should have taken more photos\").\n\"For all the people who have lost someone close to them and had to continue forward with lots of strength, this award is for you,\" he said in Spanish.\nIt is the first time a Spanish-language record has been named album of the year.\nAll eight of the nominees for best new artist got their chance to shine in an extended segment celebrating \"emerging talents who are defining music's zeitgeist\".\nAmong them were Young, making her first televised performance since taking an extended break to protect her mental and physical health last year.\nJoining her were six-piece girl group Katseye, playing their love-it-or-hate-it viral hit Gnarly; and New York indie artist Sombr, sporting a spangled jumpsuit for his rendition of 12 to 12.\nAnd Dean preceded her later Grammy victory with a joyous, full-band performance of Man I Need.\nElsewhere, Justin Bieber gave a stripped down performance of his single Yukon - quite literally, as he performed wearing just boxer shorts and socks.\nTaking the opposite approach was Bruno Mars, dressed head to toe in a tailored red suit as he sashayed through his latest single, I Just Might.\nAnd Gaga sported an elaborate birdcage/lampshade headpiece for a grinding electro version of Abracadabra, which went on to win best pop song.\nCountry legend Reba McEntire made her Grammy performance debut, playing  Trailblazer during an In Memoriam section that honoured Jimmy Cliff, Connie Francis, Gwen McCrae and Roy Ayers, among others.\nBruce Springsteen recorded a special tribute to Beach Boys star Brian Wilson, while Chaka Khan eulogised funk pioneer Sly Stone.\nMetal legend Ozzy Osbourne received a tribute of his own, with an all-star band including Post Malone, Guns N' Roses' Slash and Duff McKagan, and The Red Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith playing the Black Sabbath classic War Pigs.\nWatching from the audience were Osbourne's widow Sharon and children Jack and Kelly.\nFinally, Lauryn Hill paid her respects to Angie Stone, Roberta Flack and R&B star D'Angelo.\n\"D and I never got to do this on stage together,\" she said, introducing Nothing Even Matters, a D'Angelo duet from her Grammy-winning album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\nShe was then joined by Chaka Khan, Jon Batiste, Wyclef Jean and John Legend for a medley of Flack's hits, closing with a celebratory version of Killing Me Softly, which Hill took to number one with The Fugees in 1996.\nKnown for their hits Chelsea Dagger and Whistle for the Choir, the Glasgow band said the tour would be rescheduled.\nOnly the Poets perform at the O2 Brixton Academy after selling tickets for £1 each.\nThe 24-year-old bagged her second-ever Grammy beating three Nigerians and a Ugandan.\nSinger-songwriter Ben Howard is announced as one of the headline acts at this summer's Eden Sessions.\nThe Buddhist spiritual leader is recognised in the audiobook category for his meditations.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Carpenter also performed at the 2026 awards ceremony.\nBad Bunny went for a classic tux and bow tie designed by Schiaparelli and inspired by the shape of one of the French fashion house's early fragrance bottles. The Puerto Rican musician was nominated in six categories and became the first artist in the 68-year history of the Grammys to win album of the year with a record sung entirely in Spanish.\nChappell Roan's deep red Mugler gown and cape hid a revealing outfit that was one of the most talked-about dresses of this year's ceremony.\nLady Gaga, who was nominated for album of the year, returned to the feathered look she debuted at last year's ceremony. The Abracadabra singer pulled arrived in a custom Matières Fécales hourglass-shaped gown.\nTrevor Noah hosted the awards for a sixth – and final – time.\nJustin Bieber wore badges saying \"Ice out\" on his Balenciaga suit. He was accompanied by his wife Hailey in a custom Alaia gown with sheer panels.\nKesha was among the last of the stars to walk the red carpet, making an entrance in an all-white Atelier Biser dress with bare shoulders. It marked her return to the Grammys since last attending in 2018.\nCanadian singer and composer Tate McRae was also one of the last to arrive but she went the opposite way, sartorially speaking, wearing a long black Balenciaga dress.\nSupermodel Heidi Klum is surely used to making even the most form-fitting designs work on the runway, and her look for the Grammys red carpet was no different.\nHer flesh-toned dress earned plenty of stares as Klum struggled to walk past the photographers. But she never stopped smiling on the journey.\nRapper Killer Mike, who was nominated for best contemporary Christian music performance/song for his song Headphones, walked the red carpet with his wife, Shana Render.\nRender was one of many performers and guests who got the memo to wear gold.\nVenezuelan artist Raniero Palm, who was nominated for best classical instrumental solo for Hope Orchestrated, made a not-so-subtle political statement when he walked the red carpet with his country's flag.\nBest new artist nominee Addison Rae brought new meaning to her song High Fashion on the red carpet. She paired her fitted white Alaïa-designed dress with very, very high stilettos.\nPharrell Williams was an early winner on the night, bagging best rap performance for his feature on Clipse and Kendrick Lamar's Chains & Whips, before later being given the Grammys global impact award.\nAs men's creative director for Louis Vuitton he probably got a discount on this pink velour suit too.\nOlivia Dean was the UK's standout success on the night in LA, becoming the first Brit to win best new artist since Dua Lipa in 2019. She accepted her award in a custom Chanel gown with sequins and feathers.\nFellow Brit Yungblud gave Sharon Osbourne a big hug on the red carpet after winning best rock performance, early on in proceedings, for his live tribute to her late husband - former Black Sabbath star Ozzy.\nK-Pop idol Rosé pictured on the red carpet shortly before kicking off the ceremony with an explosive performance alongside Bruno Mars. She wore a Giambattista Valli dress styled by celebrity fashion guru Law Roach.\nKatseye caught the eye on the red carpet too, coordinating in Ludovic de Saint Sernin lace gowns.\nThe girl group were nominated for both best new artist and best pop duo/group performance for their track Gabriela.\nAnother Brit abroad, Lola Young performed her hit Messy but looked pretty smart in a shirt and tie under a baggy Vivienne Westwood outfit.\nKnown for their hits Chelsea Dagger and Whistle for the Choir, the Glasgow band said the tour would be rescheduled.\nOnly the Poets perform at the O2 Brixton Academy after selling tickets for £1 each.\nSinger-songwriter Ben Howard is announced as one of the headline acts at this summer's Eden Sessions.\nOther prizes went to Billie Eilish, Olivia Dean and Lady Gaga, at a ceremony dominated by politics.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Speaking to the podcast And The Writer Is..., she said it had been inspired by Michael Jackson's 1987 single The Way You Make Me Feel and Haribo's insanely fizzy Tangfastic sweets.\n\"I came in that day and there was a lot of energy in the room,\" she recalled. \"And I was like, 'Guys, let's make something really fun. I want to make something I can dance to. I want to make something that when I perform live, it's just gonna be like a Tangfastic'.\n\"We started with the drum beat and I was like, 'Yeah, I want to do something kind of like Michael [Jackson]'s The Way You Make Me Feel-esque'.\n\"And I sat at the Wurly [a Wurlitzer electric piano] and we kind of just, like, wrote it.\"\nIt's not just the music that has made Dean stand out.\nEarly in her career, she railed against being pigeonholed as an R&B artist when her music spanned genres like pop, alternative and folk, alongside throwback soul.\n\"I have sometimes felt quite boxed in, like I have to make 'urban' music,\" she said, but \"I feel like I can do anything\".\nLast year, she made headlines again after demanding, and obtaining, a refund for fans who had bought resale tickets for her US tour from Ticketmaster.\nThe star wrote an open letter to ticketing companies after some tickets were listed at more than 14 times their original face value, with prices rising above $1,000 (£750).\nDean called the practice \"disgusting\" and \"vile\", prompting Ticketmaster to announce a price cap on resale tickets, and promise to refund fans \"for any markup they already paid\" on its service.\nShowing that she's unafraid to stand up for her fans increased the praise she's received from all quarters of the industry - including Sir Elton John, who interrupted the singer's camping trip to offer congratulations on her award nominations.\nDean's Grammy win comes just weeks after she - along with Lola Young - dominated the nominations for this year's Brit Awards , with five nods, including artist of the year.\nOn Sunday, the singer fended off Young as well as influencers-turned-pop stars Addison Rae and Alex Warren, girl group Katseye, rock star Sombr and US indie pop band The Marías to win the best new artist category.\nFor the second year in a row, all eight nominees performed during a special segment at Sunday night's ceremony - dubbed the biggest night in music.\nThat will have allowed her to win over yet more fans who may not have known her before.\n\"I think what Olivia has is charm,\" said Stuart Worden, principal of the Brit performing arts school, which Dean attended from the age of 15.\n\"She's a real hard worker, so she would have worked really hard on her stage presence, really hard on her stagecraft, she would have worked really hard on her songwriting,\" he said.\nBroadcaster Abbie McCarthy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Dean \"oozes this superstar charm\".\nMcCarthy promoted one of Dean's early gigs in 2020, and \"even then she had that star power\", she said.\n\"The classic styling and the elegance that she brings on stage, she's going to go down as a classic legend, I think,\" McCarthy added.\n\"She's no longer the best-kept secret. She is the star that she's always deserved to be.\"\nCopyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

He reads the game well and is good on the ball.\n\"He's not a proper ball-playing centre-back yet. Technically, there is a lot to improve on, but he's a smart kid and he can get there and become like a Virgil van Dijk.\"\nAt Rennes, Jacquet has primarily played in a back three this season. When he was 18, he wanted more game time so they loaned him out to Clermont in Ligue 2 but he was was only there for half a season before he was recalled in January 2025, and made a total of 36 Ligue 1 appearances.\nHis strength in the air has been a standout this season, winning 75.51% of his aerial duels - the highest among Ligue 1 defenders in 2025â26.\nJacquet set for Â£60m Liverpool summer move\nGiven the unforgiving nature of his position, it's no surprise there have been some mistakes.\nJacquet has made three errors leading to shots, with only seven players in the French top flight making more.\nDescribing his style of play to L'Equipe, via Ligue 1, Jacquet said: \"I'm calm on the ball, maybe I can look a bit nonchalant - but I'm focused. What defines me is playing out well, breaking lines with the right pass.\"\nHe was named in the Under-19 Euros team of the tournament in 2024 and has represented and captained France at youth level. That alone tells you about his leadership qualities.\nAnd he was born in Bondy, the Paris commune where Kylian Mbappe and William Saliba come from.\nGiven the price tag, there will undoubtedly be a sense of expectation when Jacquet arrives. With Italian Giovanni Leoni also returning from an ACL injury in the summer, the Liverpool backline could look very different come the start of next season.\nLiverpool have kept an eye on Jacquet, who held talks with Chelsea too, but their interest accelerated over the weekend with the player setting his heart on a move to Anfield.\nThe understanding is Jacquet was convinced by the Liverpool project, as opposed to Chelsea where the proposition was less attractive, given they have two other elite young defenders in the squad in Josh Acheampong and Mamadou Sarr.\nAs it stands, both Andy Robertson and Ibrahima Konate are out of contract at Liverpool this summer, while captain Van Dijk, 34, and Joe Gomez's contracts expire in 2027.\nA move now would not have been wise because it's unlikely Jacquet would get in ahead of Van Dijk and Konate this season. At Rennes, who are pushing for a place in Europe, he will continue as a regular starter and benefit from getting more playing time in Ligue 1.\nFor Jacquet, the challenge between now and the summer is to prepare for life in the Premier League. He is by no means a finished product and Rennes' 4-0 defeat at Monaco on Saturday showed the margins where he can improve, especially when it comes to decision-making when stepping out of the defensive line.\nIt is worth noting that two of the biggest recent transfers from Ligue 1 to the Premier League have found it challenging, with both Manchester United 's Leny Yoro (Â£52m) and Manchester City 's Abdukodir Khusanov (Â£34m) finding their respective early stints tough.\n\"It won't be easy to step up from Ligue 1 to the Premier League at a club like Liverpool ,\" adds Laurens. \"It wasn't easy for Leny Yoro and it wasn't easy for William Saliba at the beginning too, but Jacquet is so so talented.\"\nIn the last six months, Liverpool have signed five centre-backs aged 20 or under.\nLeoni, 19, arrived from Parma for Â£26m in the summer, while the Reds completed deals for Noah Adekoya, also 19, Senegalese 18-year-old Mor Talla Ndiaye and Austria youth international Ifeanyi Ndukwe, 17, in January.\nAdekoya joined from Burnley , while both Ndiaye and Ndukwe impressed Liverpool scouts at the Under-17 World Cup in Qatar last November.\nNdiaye then completed a Â£1m move from Amitie - the Senegalese club owned by former Chelsea and Newcastle striker Demba Ba - and has represented Senegal at youth level.\nNdukwe reached the final with Austria and will join Liverpool in the summer from Austria Vienna, with the fee potentially rising to Â£2.5m.\nThe sheer number of signings is an indication the Anfield club are future-proofing their central defensive options.\nAt first-team level, it is an area where change is inevitable - and no secret they tried and failed in their pursuit of a proven talent in Marc Guehi last summer.\nInvesting such a large sum on an unproven talent like Jacquet may be deemed a risk, but Liverpool believe they have done their homework on him as they build a squad for the next generation.\nThe average age of their signings over the last two transfer windows is lower than than 22, although the club still believe that such a group of new players can bring high levels of quality and performance in the short, medium and long term.\nStats provided by BBC Sport journalist Matt Jones\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\nPalace sign Strand Larsen in deal worth up to Â£48m but McNeil loan off\nKendrick Lamar: The artist who has reshaped modern hip-hop\nA high stakes, globetrotting cat-and-mouse game\nCould Heated Rivalry positively influence ice hockey?\nLewis Moody opens up about his MND diagnosis\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid?

They've slotted in really well, which is testament to them.\"\nCrystal Palace 's deadline day move for Strand Larsen meant they spent Â£83m in the winter window, having signed Brennan Johnson for Â£35m from Tottenham .\nAston Villa - who are third - were the only other top-six side to pay out transfer fees during the winter window. They spent Â£18.25m on bringing back striker Tammy Abraham from Besiktas and Â£10.5m on winger Alysson from Gremio.\nPremier League leaders Arsenal did no business during the winter window, with Manchester United , Chelsea and Liverpool - fourth, fifth and sixth respectively - also quiet.\nWhile Manchester City spent money to bolster their squad for a title fight, at the other end of the table West Ham splashed out in a bid to avoid relegation to the Championship.\nThe Hammers, who are third from bottom and six points adrift of safety, spent a reported Â£21.8m on Brazilian striker Pablo Felipe from Portuguese club Gil Vicente and around Â£25m on striker Taty Castellanos from Lazio.\nTottenham , who are 14th, spent Â£35m on signing forward Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid, while Bournemouth used some of their money from the Semenyo sale to sign teenage striker Rayan from Vasco da Gama for Â£24.7m and Hungary midfielder Alex Toth for Â£10.4m from Ferencvaros.\nDespite a quiet deadline day, Premier League clubs still spent more overall in the winter window than sides in other major European leagues.\nThe next-biggest spending league was Serie A, with their clubs paying out a combined Â£205m in transfer fees.\nSassuolo were one of the most active Italian clubs, paying Â£22m for Marseille duo Ismael Kone and Darryl Bakola.\nIn Spain, the transfer window closed at 22:59 GMT, but La Liga business was quiet, with Atletico Madrid's Â£30m deal for Ademola Lookman more than was spent be the rest of the division's clubs combined (Â£20.3m).\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\nPalace sign Strand Larsen in deal worth up to Â£48m but McNeil loan off\nKendrick Lamar: The artist who has reshaped modern hip-hop\nA high stakes, globetrotting cat-and-mouse game\nCould Heated Rivalry positively influence ice hockey?\nLewis Moody opens up about his MND diagnosis\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid?

In the 2002-03 season, the Hammers picked up 42 points but were still relegated.\nSunderland with 40 points in 1996-97 and Bolton with 40 points the following year are the only other sides to have dropped down after touching the 40-point mark.\nTottenham finished 17th last term with 38 points but, because of the weaknesses of the promoted trio, they would still have beaten the drop with just 26.\nThe season before, 17th-placed Nottingham Forest managed 32 points - a tally which included a four points deduction - but actually only needed 27 to stay up.\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\nPalace sign Strand Larsen in deal worth up to Â£48m but McNeil loan off\nKendrick Lamar: The artist who has reshaped modern hip-hop\nA high stakes, globetrotting cat-and-mouse game\nCould Heated Rivalry positively influence ice hockey?\nLewis Moody opens up about his MND diagnosis\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid?

with Dwight McNeil's switch from Everton breaking down at the 11th hour.\nNorway striker Jorgen Strand Larsen arrived from Wolves in a deal worth up to Â£48m but, seeing a loan agreement for McNeil with a Â£20m obligation to buy in the summer failing due to late paperwork, transfer deadline day would have done little to ease the fans' mood.\nIn signing Strand Larsen, Palace broke their club record for the second time in the same window, having acquired forward Brennan Johnson from Tottenham for Â£35m early last month.\nBut with their captain Marc Guehi gone without a replacement found, striker Jean Philippe-Mateta wanting away but failing a deadline-day medical , manager Oliver Glasner already on his way out and a deal for McNeil breaking down, have the struggling Palace addressed the faults running through the spine or their team?\nPalace are the second-biggest spenders behind Man City this month but have they merely stuck a glossy bandage over their problems?\nPalace sign Strand Larsen in deal worth up to Â£48m but McNeil loan off\nMateta's move from Palace to AC Milan called off\nMarc Guehi captained Crystal Palace to their first major title in the FA Cup final last season\nLess than eight months ago, Palace fans were living a dream as their side won the FA Cup and qualified for a first-ever European campaign.\nThey would have hoped for that triumph to be a springboard for further success - a platform to grow and continue their upward trajectory under Glasner.\nEberechi Eze, their match winner against Manchester City at Wembley, was the first to depart for Arsenal in a deal worth up to Â£68m in the summer.\nEze scored 40 goals in 169 games for Palace and claimed 14 goals and 11 assists in all competitions last season.\nWithout their star forward, Palace were already developing cracks on the field when the January window laid the turmoil at the club bare.\nOn 16 January during a routine news conference, Glasner, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2024 and guided the club to their first major titles, announced he will leave when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nThe news came with centre-back Guehi on the verge of completing his move to City.\nGuehi has since left and top scorer Mateta almost followed him through the exit doors this window, only for his move to AC Milan to be called off because of issues with his medical.\nAmid all the drama unfolding in the background, Palace have suffered on the pitch.\nThey are only three points ahead of 17th-placed Nottingham Forest and are 12 games without a win all competitions, including nine in the league.\nTheir form since mid-December makes for damning reading - winning the fewest points, scoring the fewest goals, losing the most games, and recording the worst goal difference in the division since matchweek 16.\nCrystal Palace are the biggest expected goals (xG) underperformers in Europe's top five leagues this season.\nBased on the number and quality of chances they have had, a team would have scored 13 more goals than Palace have in their 24 league games (25 goals versus an xG of 38).\nAnd Mateta has been the chief culprit for their struggles in front of goal, scoring four fewer than expected - though seven other Palace players are also underperforming their xG by one goal or more.\nWhile only six players have scored more than his eight goals in the league this season, only Erling Haaland and Igor Thiago have a higher xG than Mateta (12).\nThe biggest xG underperformer in the league, only three players have been more wasteful than Mateta across Europe's top five leagues.\nMateta, however, has been nursing a knee issue - the reason why Milan ordered additional tests for the France forward during his medical.\nAnd the silver lining for the Eagles is that in order for teams and players to massively underperform their xG, they have to be good enough to get a lot of quality chances in the first place.\nWhile you want players to take their chances, it shows that Palace and their attackers are getting a lot of things right.\nPalace will also want the Strand Larsen from 2024-25 at Selhurst Park rather than the one this season, a shadow of his former self.\nThe striker scored 14 league goals during the past campaign but has only found the net once this term in 22 matches.\nJorgen Strand Larsen has only scored once in 22 Premier League appearances this season\nRarely has a club-record signing been met with such scepticism.\nPalace have spent Â£48million on Strand Larsen yet the jury is out. The Norway international has scored just once in the Premier League season after all.\nOf course, Palace are banking on last season's Strand Larsen arriving, his 14 goals last season pushed Champions League Newcastle into trying to sign him last summer.\nBut there are supporters who still need to be convinced. Palace are in malaise.\nMichael Olise is gone. Eze is gone. Guehi is gone. Glasner, their manager, is leaving at the end of the season â if not before. The team is disassembling at a rate fans are apprehensive about.\nLast season's euphoric FA Cup triumph seems a distant memory; the club's spiral towards the relegation zone is in stark contrast to the jubilation of nine months ago.\nWhether Strand Larsen is the man to inject some positivity back into Selhurst Park remains to be seen.\nThe addition of Johnson will provide further options for an attack that has misfired in recent weeks, but the late saga around McNeil will have done little to ease concern.\nUncertainty reigns at Palace - can the new signings provide some direction?\nFollow live coverage of transfer deadline day\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nTwo club-record signings - but are Palace papering over the cracks?\nPalace sign Strand Larsen in deal worth up to Â£48m but McNeil loan off\nKendrick Lamar: The artist who has reshaped modern hip-hop\nA high stakes, globetrotting cat-and-mouse game\nCould Heated Rivalry positively influence ice hockey?\nLewis Moody opens up about his MND diagnosis\n'Strong and smart' - have Liverpool signed 'next Van Dijk' in Jacquet?\nAll the done deals on deadline day in one place\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid?

He walks around looking like a defecating squirrel…he's a conscious enemy of our country!\"\nWelcome to my world: the world of a BBC correspondent in Russia.\nIt's a world we offer a glimpse into in Our Man in Moscow. The film for BBC Panorama charts a year in the life of the BBC Moscow bureau, as the Kremlin continues to wage war on Ukraine, tighten the screws at home and build a relationship with President Trump.\nThe squirrel barb doesn't bother me. Squirrels are cute. And they have a thick skin - something a foreign correspondent needs here.\nI have spent more than thirty years living and working in Moscow. As a young man I fell in love with the language, literature and music of Russia. At university in Leeds, I ran a choir that performed Russian folk classics. For one concert I wrote a song in Russian about a snowman who put on so many clothes that he melted.\nLike that snowman, the Russia I knew seemed to melt away in February 2022. With its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the world's largest country had embarked on the darkest of paths. President Putin's \"special military operation\" would become the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two.\nLooking back, this hadn't come out of nowhere: Russia had annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014; it had already been accused of funding, fuelling and orchestrating an armed uprising in eastern Ukraine. Relations with the West were becoming increasingly strained.\nStill, the full-scale invasion was a watershed moment.\nIn the days that followed, repressive new laws were adopted here to silence dissent and punish criticism of the authorities. BBC platforms were blocked. Suddenly reporting from Russia felt like walking a tightrope over a legal minefield. The challenge: to report accurately and honestly about what was happening without falling off the highwire.\nIn 2023 the arrest of a Wall Street Journal reporter showed that a foreign passport was no \"keep out of jail\" card. Evan Gershkovich, a US citizen, was convicted on espionage charges. He would spend sixteen months behind bars. He, his employer and the US authorities denounced the case as a sham.\nIn the BBC's Moscow office we're a much smaller team now. Together we try to navigate the daily challenges of reporting the Russia story.\nProducer Ben Tavener and I often face \"additional checks\" flying in and out of Russia. Reporters from countries labelled \"unfriendly\" by the Kremlin (that includes the UK) are no longer issued one-year permits. Our journalist visas and accreditation cards require renewal every three months.\nMany contributors who used to speak to us are now reluctant to do so. Probably they think that at a time of heightened international tension being associated with the BBC isn't worth the risk.\nYet along with other Western broadcasters that have retained a presence in Russia we have still been receiving invitations to Kremlin events.\nAnd sometimes I get the chance to quiz President Putin.\nEven a single question and answer at a press conference can provide valuable insight into the Russian president's thinking.\nVladimir Putin is driven by resentment of the West: over Nato's enlargement eastwards, and what he perceives as years of disrespect for Russia from Western leaders. His critics accuse him of imperialist designs, of trying to reforge Russia's sphere of influence.\n\"Will there be new 'special military operations'?\" I asked President Putin last December as a part of a wider question about his plans.\n\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect. If you respect our interests…\" the Kremlin leader replied.\nWhich raises the question: if Vladimir Putin concludes that Russia's interests have not been respected, what then?\nWith Donald Trump back in the White House, Moscow feels that Washington is paying it more respect. At the Alaska summit last August, America's president rolled out the red carpet for Russia's leader. By inviting him to Anchorage Donald Trump had brought Vladimir Putin in from the cold, even though the summit failed to end Russia's war on Ukraine.\nIt hasn't all gone Moscow's way. Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro, captured recently by US troops, was Russia's ally. Then America seized an oil tanker in the Atlantic: it was sailing under a Russian flag.\nStill, it's striking how little the Kremlin has criticised America over the last 12 months. Moscow seems to believe good relations with the Trump administration will help it end the Ukraine war on terms beneficial to the Kremlin.\nSo now most of the anti-Western rhetoric in the Russian state media is directed, not at America, but at the European Union and the UK.\nIn 1997 I was invited onto \"The White Parrot Club\", a popular Russian TV comedy show starring a white parrot called Arkasha. Russian celebrities sat around in a bar telling each other British jokes and speaking lovingly of the UK.\n\"In 1944 I was on the frontline in World War Two,\" recalled film legend Yuri Nikulin. \"I remember how Britain and the Allies opened the Second Front. That helped us so much.\"\nThe Parrot Club fraternity invited me to \"sing something British\". I sat at the piano and sang about \"Daisy! Daisy!\" and \"a bicycle made for two\".\nSitting in that Moscow bar, it felt as if Britain couldn't be closer to Russian hearts. I remember thinking that Russia and the West were on that \"bicycle made for two\", and that Cold War-style confrontation was all in the past.\nIn thirty years, we've gone from \"white parrots\" to \"defecating squirrels\".\nFar worse, we've swung from hopes of East-West friendship to a four-year-long war in Europe that has been devastating, first and foremost, for Ukraine.\nHow this war ends will affect not only Ukraine's future and that of Russia, but the future of Europe, too.\nOver the last four years there have been moments that have shocked me. I'll never forget my conversation with Vera at a highly choreographed pro-Putin rally in 2022. I'd asked her if she had a son. She had.\n\"Aren't you worried,\" I asked, \"that he might be drafted into the army and sent to Ukraine?\"\n\"I'd rather my son was killed fighting in Ukraine than see him getting up to mischief at home,\" Vera replied. \"Look how many young men here have no job and spend their time getting drunk.\"\nThere have been more pleasant encounters, too. A few days after TV host Vladimir Solovyov labelled me an \"enemy of Russia,\" several Muscovites came up to me to shake my hand and ask for selfies.\nIt's like Russia's national symbol: the double-headed eagle. One head is growling and calling you a \"defecating squirrel.\"\nThe other is saying: \"Thanks for being here.\"\nStarlink-enabled drones have been linked to a number of recent deadly attacks by Russia on Ukraine.\nClinton Nyapara Mogesa is said to have been recruited in Qatar to fight for Russian forces in Ukraine.\nFifteen others were reported injured in the strike near a bus carrying the workers on Sunday.\nResidents in the Ukrainian capital are finding joy in unusual places, despite power cuts caused by Russian attacks and freezing winter temperatures.\nAlready facing electricity cuts, civilians are struggling to keep warm in their own homes as temperatures are set to plummet.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

But Israel blocked it until the return of the body of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza, which happened last week.\nIt will come as a relief to many Palestinians who see it as a lifeline to the world, although there is frustration that only small numbers of people and no goods will be allowed through.\nAround 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians are waiting to leave Gaza for treatment, according to local hospitals and the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIsraeli reports say only 50 patients - accompanied by one or two relatives - will be allowed to exit each day, and that 50 people who left Gaza during the war will be allowed to return.\nIt is understood that there was disagreement over whether carers should be allowed to return from Egypt with former patients as part of that quota, which caused some delays.\nThe crossing will be run by supervisors from the European Union and local Palestinian staff, while Israel will carry out stringent security checks remotely.\nOn Monday morning, an Israeli security official said the Rafah crossing had \"now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit\" following the arrival of teams from the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM).\nAl Qahera News TV, which is close to Egyptian intelligence, meanwhile said the crossing had \"received the first batch of Palestinians returning from Egypt to the Gaza Strip\".\nAfter sunset, Al Qahera broadcast footage appearing to show ambulances transferring patients across the border into Egypt.\n\"Three ambulances have arrived so far carrying a number of the sick and injured, who were immediately screened upon arrival to determine to which hospital they will be transferred,\" an Egyptian health official at the border told AFP news agency.\nA Palestinian mother, Sabrine al-Da'ma, told the BBC she was hoping to travel abroad with her 16-year-old daughter, Rawa, who suffers from kidney disease. She plans to donate Rawa one of her kidneys.\n\"She used to be treated through monitoring, ultrasound imaging and tests to check the condition of her kidneys. Since the war started, because of food shortages, hunger, and the food she was forced to eat, she began dialysis,\" Da'ma said.\n\"We hope they will speed up our referral so that we can travel quickly, because she is getting exhausted. I am also 45 years old, and they may tell me that as I get older, I won't be able to donate anymore. That's why we're rushing.\"\nMaha Ali, 26, told the BBC that she was hoping to leave Gaza to study a master's degree in Algeria, but that she had previously been told by Israeli authorities that they did not consider students to be \"humanitarian cases\".\n\"By now, I was supposed to have defended my master's thesis and started my PhD, but two years of my life have been lost. I am now in Gaza and I have not been able to do anything I had planned,\" she said.\nThe head of the Palestinian technocratic committee due to take over day-to-day running of Gaza, Ali Shaath, said the reopening of the crossing marked \"the beginning of a long process that will reconnect what has been severed and open a genuine window of hope for our people in the Gaza Strip\".\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said: \"The opening of the Rafah crossing marks a concrete and positive step in the peace plan.\"\nUK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also welcomed the move, but stressed that \"much more still needs to be done\". \"Aid must flow in, restrictions on essential supplies must ease, and aid workers must be allowed to operate,\" she added.\nOn Sunday, Israeli authorities said a trial opening of the crossing was carried out and completed.\nOne Palestinian official familiar with the arrangements for the trial told the BBC that around 30 Palestinian staff members had arrived at the Egyptian side of the crossing, ahead of the initial operational phase.\nThe WHO will oversee the transfer of patients from territory under Hamas control, transporting them by bus to the crossing over the \"Yellow Line\" and into territory controlled by the Israeli military.\nAbout 150 hospitals and 300 ambulances in Egypt are ready to receive the evacuated patients, according to Al Qahera News.\nTrump's 20-point Gaza peace plan says the reopening of the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under a previous ceasefire deal in January last year.\nBefore being seized by Israel in 2024, the crossing was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the war and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. Now, aid that enters from Egypt is routed via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing point.\nIn December, the Israeli government said the Rafah crossing would open to allow Palestinians to leave Gaza. But Egypt said the crossing would only be opened if movement was allowed in both directions.\nMore than 30,000 Gazans have registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo to be allowed to return to Gaza.\nThe crossing's opening was delayed due to the Israeli government making it conditional on Hamas handing over the body of the last dead Israeli hostage in Gaza.\nLast week, the Israeli military said its troops had retrieved the remains of police officer Master Sgt Ran Gvili at a cemetery in northern Gaza.\nHe was one of the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies during their attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed around 1,200 people.\nIsrael's military campaign in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, has killed more than 71,800 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nBoth sides have accused each other of repeated violations since the ceasefire began 16 weeks ago. The health ministry has said 526 people have been killed by Israeli fire, while the Israeli military has said four of its soldiers have been killed in Palestinian attacks.\nMedical charity Medicine Sans Frontières said it would not share the list as it had not been able to ensure staff would remain safe.\nAnalysts believe PM Netanyahu is urging the US towards maximalist strikes.\nIn a highly controversial move, some Israeli MPs are trying to introduce the death penalty for Palestinian attackers.\nSouth Africa accuses the Israeli envoy of insulting President Ramaphosa. Israel says the expulsion is \"baseless\".\nIn his first international interview, Sasha Troufanov tells the BBC how he thought he would die in captivity after he was taken hostage on 7 October 2023.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

It has worked in Ukraine since the first days of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 .\nThe Russian drones are difficult to shoot down, Fedorov said, as they fly at low altitudes, cannot be countered with electronic warfare, and are controlled by operators in real time from a distance.\nThe Institute for the Study of War warned in mid-January that since Russia had begun equipping the cheap kamikaze Molniya-2 drones with Starlink, their battlefield efficiency had increased \"dramatically\".\nWhile neither Fedorov nor Musk elaborated on what the response had been, the defence ministry's official website ArmiyaInform reported that SpaceX had introduced a speed limit of 75kph on Starlink terminals moving over Ukraine.\n\"Russian drones move much more quickly, so the enemy operators will not be able to control them in real time,\" the website said.\nOn Monday Fedorov said the Ukrainian government was also preparing to implement a white list of approved Starlink satellite terminals which could operate in Ukraine. All unregistered terminals will be disconnected, Fedorov said.\n\"We are implementing this in cooperation with SpaceX,\" Fedorov stated, adding that instructions on registering the terminals would be forthcoming.\nRussian war bloggers warned the implications could go beyond drones, as the Russian military uses Starlink to provide the front line with internet.\nFedorov - then deputy prime minister - asked for Musk's help soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. By the end of the day Musk said Starlink had been enabled in Ukraine and promised more satellite dishes.\nBut shortly after supplying Ukraine with Starlink, Musk's relationship with Kyiv became turbulent.\nLater in 2022 he denied the Ukrainian military access to Starlink in Crimea, where Russia has been stationing military equipment since illegally annexing in 2014.\nAt the time, Musk justified the decision by saying that Ukraine would have used Starlink access to \"sink most of the Russian fleet\", making SpaceX \"complicit in a major act of war\".\nMusk has since repeatedly criticised Western countries for providing Ukraine with funding and weaponry. \"It is insane to keep sending so much money to Ukraine with no accountability and no end game,\" he said.\nHowever, he has also stated that \"no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals.\"\n\"My Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off,\" Musk said in March.\nDespite these tensions, Fedorov last week again praised Musk's timely decision to provide his country with access at the start of the full-scale invasion, saying Starlink had been \"critically important for the stability of our state\".\nThe 35-year-old former digital transformation minister was appointed to head the ministry of defence by President Volodymyr Zelensky last month.\nFedorov favours a data-driven strategy and advanced cyber-warfare. He has also vowed to work closely with Silicon Valley companies, arguing that integrating partners would make Ukraine's defence system stronger.\nMusk's space exploration company and his AI start-up are merging.\nThe first crewed Moon mission in 50 years could launch in February, ahead of a future lunar landing.\nThe firm wants to create a network of \"orbital data centres\" to power artificial intelligence.\nResidents in the Ukrainian capital are finding joy in unusual places, despite power cuts caused by Russian attacks and freezing winter temperatures.\nAlready facing electricity cuts, civilians are struggling to keep warm in their own homes as temperatures are set to plummet.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

The attack was part of a wave of kidnappings for ransom affecting many parts of Nigeria, but no group has said it was behind the abductions.\nThe raid was initially denied by police, who only confirmed the kidnappings on 21 January after local residents had reported to the BBC that 177 worshippers were abducted, with 11 escaping shortly afterwards.\nThe official response drew criticism from Amnesty International, which accused Nigerian authorities of \"desperate denial\".\nThe rights group urged officials to \"take immediate and concrete measures to prevent rampant abductions that are gradually becoming the norm in Nigeria.\"\nIn November, more than 300 students and teachers were taken from a Catholic school in Niger state, which neighbours Kaduna, before being released in two groups.\nNigeria faces multiple, overlapping security challenges beyond kidnappings, including an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and frequent clashes between herders and farmers in central regions over land and water.\nSecurity experts say efforts to tackle these crises are hampered by corruption, poor intelligence sharing, and underfunded local police forces.\nThe security situation has drawn international attention.

The United Nations says 90% of Syrians live below the poverty line.\nIn early January, Kabawat rushed to the northern city of Aleppo to visit shelters harbouring thousands of people after fighting flared between government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who have long dominated north-eastern Syria.\nLast summer, she tried to bring aid into a southern city populated mostly by Druze after it was torn by deadly violence between Druze, Bedouin and Syrian government forces.\nAnd she reached out to the family of an Alawite woman, from the same minority Shia sect as the Assad family, who accused armed men in military fatigues of rape.\nThere are some complaints Kabawat could do more to help mend the fractures between Syria's different communities.\nAsked if the government made mistakes in its response to the sectarian violence, she replies: \"Mistakes happen in transition, in post-conflict; no-one is happy about it, including the president.\"\nBut she stresses an inquiry was set up, and now \"many of those who committed those crimes are in prison\".\nUnderstanding how to build trust, and peace, has defined much of her working life. Educated at universities in Syria, Lebanon, Canada and the United States, Kabawat is a lawyer and negotiator who played a leading role in the exiled Syrian opposition during the civil war.\nIn her own arsenal, she sees her sharpest tool as dialogue.\n\"It's taking time for people to say 'we trust you' after 50 years of dictatorship,\" she explains, emphasising that trust is needed \"people to people\" as well as between government and the population.\nWe travel with her to the provincial capital of Idlib in the north-west, the former rebel stronghold of Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham forces.\nShe worked here during the civil war, with Tastakel, a women-led organisation she founded. Its name translates roughly from Arabic as \"becoming independent\" - which also sums up her philosophy on building this new Syria.\nIn a packed, brightly-lit hall, young and old women, and some men, from across Syria, are gathered to celebrate the end of the old order, and to strategise about strengthening the role of women at all levels of decision-making.\nFor Kabawat, it is about taking responsibility.\nIn recent indirect elections for the new transitional parliament, or People's Assembly, not a single woman was elected from Idlib. Overall, only 4% of seats went to female candidates.\n\"You should have been united and thought in a politically intelligent way to ensure we got one or two women elected,\" she scolds the women.\nYou could feel the energy coursing through the room of well-spoken women, some wearing tightly wrapped headscarves, others in head-to-toe veils, and some -including Kabawat - bare-headed.\nThis has always been the female face of Syria, a society often described as a mosaic of many traditions. Initial concerns that stricter Islamist rules would be imposed by Sharaa and his supporters, who adhere to a strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, have not materialised in the main, but worries still linger for some.\nSharaa himself, a former al-Qaeda commander-turned-Islamist rebel leader, has shucked his military fatigues for a tailored Western-style suit and now positions himself as a pragmatist.\nKabawat says that on that first day, when he announced his government in March last year, the president assured her more women would be appointed. \"He said: 'It's coming, we are in transition,'\" she adds.\nAny suggestion she is a token woman in his ranks meets a firm rebuke.\n\"I am not here for window dressing,\" she declares. \"I don't feel that I am a Christian or a woman when I do my job. I feel like I am a citizen of Syria... The minute I start feeling like I'm a minority or I'm a woman, I will lose my legitimacy.\"\nAt the conference in Idlib, there's a sudden sign of a changing society.  Kabawat is ambushed by an enthusiastic crowd of young women talking excitedly over each other - former students from her Tastakel classes.\n\"We're implementing the mission she taught us and we are trying to acquire more expertise so we are ready,\" says one of them, Siwar.\nKabawat exclaims in approval as another, Ghufran, wags her finger for emphasis: \"We either occupy a space where we hold all the decision-making power, or we don't want to be in that space at all.\"\nEven in deeply conservative Idlib, women of an earlier generation played leadership roles in civil society during the war.\nSoftly-spoken and exuding confidence, Ahlam al-Rasheed is now the director of social affairs in the provincial government.\nNearly a decade ago, in 2017, she earned a place on the BBC's 100 Women list with her work promoting women's rights.\nDuring the civil war, women \"led across several sectors, including in politics, relief, education and health\", she says. Many were - and still are - the main breadwinners in their families.\nWe travel to a bleak tented camp on barren land on the edge of the city, where we see the reality of what Rasheed says is the biggest challenge facing Syrian women now.\nThis camp, and countless others dotting the country, house millions of Syrians whose homes still lie in utter ruin.\nKabawat briefly greets the robed and suited men standing in line to receive her. Then she makes a beeline for a gaggle of giggling children and expectant women, most in flowing black cloaks. The jaunty wool cap pulled over her honey-brown hair may be her nod to both the cold winter weather and more conservative ways.\nInside a tented mosque, she sits on the floor listening to a litany of woes from women, many of them widows, living in grinding poverty and pain, without assistance.\nAgain, Kabawat throws it back to them, asking who would like to be taught to make handicrafts to be sold internationally. A sea of hands rise.\nThen, she is on her way, leading a \"choo-choo train\" formed by a line of delighted children, sprinkling humour, happiness and even a little hope, but not the real aid they so desperately need.\nLater I ask her what she said to the man who lamented that he had worked so hard in the opposition but was still living in a tent.\n\"Of course, they're right,\" she reflects. \"I feel their pain.\" She highlights the urgent need for \"a united effort from the international community\".\nI point out that donors say the government also has to move more quickly to establish a new legal system, as well as transparency.\n\"Of course, they're not right,\" she shoots back. \"We inherited a country which was completely destroyed and we're working on laws to renew and adapt a new country - so it's taking time.\"\nHer tone is even more emphatic when I ask about reports that Sharaa's inner circle is now creating a shadow government by taking away ministers' power to appoint their own deputies.\n\"I won't be here the minute I see that I can't appoint my own deputy and don't have the freedom to make my own strategy,\" she declares. \"Nobody controls me.\"\nSharaa \"cannot rely on one side\", she adds. \"If he's not going to be inclusive and bring many people together in the government… we can't survive.\"\nPost-Assad Syria has received hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from many countries.\nAn American push - with President Donald Trump's personal backing - has helped lift crippling sanctions.\nBut the World Bank estimates that Syria will need at least $200bn (£145bn), just to rebuild its shattered landscape. And some donors are hesitating because of volatility in the country and wider region, exacerbated by Israel's repeated attacks on its neighbour.\nIsrael says it is acting against perceived threats posed by Syria's armed groups.\nAs we sit in Kabawat's graceful living room, among framed family photographs and sprays of Syria's new flag, her can-do composure breaks for a moment.\n\"I see the suffering of the people... and feel responsible for their pain,\" she admits, wiping a tear. She says when she feels she does not have the resources to help people, that is the one time she asks herself \"why did I do this?\"\nThen there's a rustle outside the door. Another delegation is waiting to see her.\n\"Khalas [enough], enough of tears,\" she vows. \"It's another day and it's back to work.\"\nViewers in the UK can also watch the interview on Global Eye at 19:00 on Monday 2 February on BBC Two or on iPlayer\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

But at some locations, it is actually an AI robot entering the orders.\nBehind the counter inside the store, baristas can lean on a virtual personal assistant to recall recipes or manage schedules.\nIn the back of the shop, a scanning tool has taken on the painstaking process of counting the inventory, relieving staff of one of retail's most tedious chores, in a bid to fix the out-of-stock gaps that have frustrated the firm.\nThe new technology is part of the hundreds of millions of dollars the 55-year-old coffee giant has been investing as it tries to win back customers after several years of struggling sales.\nAnd there are signs that the effort is working.\nLast week, the company reported its first sales increase in two years at established stores in the US - its biggest and most important market, accounting for some 70% of revenue.\nStill, the firm's share price slid 5% reflecting investor concerns that all the spending, which includes $500m (£363m) to boost staffing, had hurt profits.\nChief executive Brian Niccol says he is confident that consistent sales growth will ultimately address that problem.\nBut with the company promising to find $2bn in cost savings over the next three years, investments in technology are crucial to ensuring that improved sales also yield better profits.\n\"I think that's all going to come,\" he told the BBC. \"I really do believe we've got the right plan in place.\"\nNiccol joined the company in 2024, at a time when the business was under pressure.\nCustomers were balking after a string of price increases. Competition was heating up and the brand faced boycott calls tied to unionised barista disputes over pay and benefits, as well as the company's stance on the Israel-Gaza war .\nThe 52-year-old, who had wowed the industry with his turnaround of fast-casual burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, quickly began making changes.\nHe declared a halt to price increases, simplified the menu and set a target for baristas to complete orders in four minutes or less.\nStarbucks also cut thousands of corporate roles, closed underperforming stores and sold off a huge stake of the firm's business in China.\nBut the father-of-three, and former fraternity brother at Ohio's Miami University, tends to talk about Starbucks’ challenges in fuzzier terms, describing a company that got caught up in spreadsheets and financial averages and strayed too far from its roots as a community coffeehouse.\n\"We lost our focus because we got a little too distracted on efficiency and technology, and lost, I think, our focus on experience, customer and connection,\" he said.\n\"The business is not an average business. The business is a coffee shop-by-coffee shop business.\"\nTo improve the vibes, staff were urged to return to writing customer names on cups by hand.\nThe firm also started sprucing up shops with inviting armchairs, new paint and ceramic mugs - all part of a $150,000-per-store \"uplift\" that is expected to take four years to complete.\nThose changes were accompanied by more hard-edged policies, such as stricter uniforms for staff and rules that bar people from using the bathroom without a purchase.\nThe firm's push to deploy AI at a time when top brass are emphasising the importance of a personal touch might seem loaded with irony, but Niccol sees little tension.\n\"It's a way for us to make the experience... have less friction,\" he said.\nThe company is trialling an AI-powered chatbot, which can help match drinks with customer moods, and is introducing the ability to schedule orders in a bid to reduce customer waits.\nAt drive-throughs, Starbucks is testing a system to process orders and free up staff to focus on hospitality or making the coffees.\nAt the firm's recent investor day, Niccol told analysts he was confident the business had momentum, outlining ambitious expansion plans - especially overseas, where it hopes to nearly double its footprint to almost 40,000 stores in the years ahead.\n\"Things are really taking hold,\" he said, before analysts started peppering him with questions about profits.\nUnlike last year, the company is not ruling out price increases.\nHowever, Niccol said: \"It really is the last lever I want to pull.

The Biden administration had halted military co-operation after coups deposed the elected civilian presidents of all three countries between 2020 and 2023, with Niger's Mohamed Bazoum still locked up in his own residence.\nThe US statement makes explicit a radical change in policy that had become increasingly evident over the 12 months since Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nThe shift started with the shuttering of USAID – a key provider of development support to the region – days after the president was sworn in for a new term.\nThis was followed by repeated signals of a much narrower focus on security and mineral resources, with both development and governance sidelined.\nThe announcement of Checker's visit goes further in openly declaring respect for Mali's sovereignty. The message will resonate in Bamako and allied capitals, where military leaders have built their appeal by striking pan-Africanist themes and rejecting former colonial power France.\nBurkina Faso's military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, presents himself as a standard-bearer in resisting \"imperialism\" and \"neo-colonialism\". Through vigorous social media promotion, he has gained huge support for this stance and personal popularity among young people across the continent and beyond.\nThe Trump administration has made plain that it is unconcerned by the regimes' rejection of the European-style constitutional model of elected civilian government.\nMassad Boulos, senior adviser for Africa at the state department and a Trump confidant, last year told the French newspaper Le Monde: \"Democracy is always appreciated, but our policy is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. People are free to choose whatever system is appropriate for them.\"\nDuring the Biden era Gen Michael Langley, head of the US military's Africa Command (Africom) from 2022 to 2025, stressed the importance of good governance and environmental issues, as complements to military support.\nHowever last year, following Trump's return to the presidency, he said that supporting the fight against terrorism was now the main focus .\nAnd that certainly seems to be the priority in West Africa, a message reiterated by Rudolph Attalah, a senior counter-terrorism official, on a visit to Bamako last year.\nThen last month Africom's deputy head, Gen John Brennan, confirmed that the US was continuing to actively support the three military-run countries in their struggle against jihadist groups, and Islamic State in particular.\nThe motives for Trump's shift in approach seem to be threefold.\nThe US, like Europe, remains seriously concerned about the long-term security threat posed by the jihadist groups now operating across the Sahel - the semi-arid stretch of land south of the Sahara Desert. According to some definitions, the region now accounts for half of all the world's terrorism deaths.\nAlthough almost all the casualties are local, there is concern in the US that the governments' loss of control of much of their territory could allow the emergence of safe havens for jihadist groups to develop further and expand.\nDiplomats and analysts routinely now describe the region as the \"epicentre of global terrorism\", which could present a long-term international threat.\nIn the \"tri-border region\", where Mali, Burkina and Niger converge, the West African offshoot of Islamic State (Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, ISGS) is particularly active.\nA fresh reminder of the scale of threat that it poses came only last week with an attack on the airport in Niamey, Niger's capital .\nThe jihadist activity is also a threat to the Sahel's export of valuable or strategically important minerals: the region is a major producer of gold and Mali also produces lithium – a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries and also used in some medication – while Niger has significant uranium reserves.\nNiger's military government has seized control of the country's main uranium mine from the longstanding French operator, Orano, and is now lining up Russia as its new partner in the sector.\nThe Trump administration also appears concerned not to leave Russia to play the role of sole external defence partner of the three countries.\nUnlike the West African regional bloc Ecowas, France, the EU and the Biden administration, today's White House does not regard the Russian military presence as a threat to regional stability or human rights. Russia has deployed about 1,000 security contractors in Mali, with smaller contingents of mercenaries or regular troops in Burkina Faso and Niger.\nThere have been numerous allegations of abuses committed by the Russians, in particular in Mali.\nWhen Attalah visited Bamako, he signalled that Washington was quite relaxed about Moscow's military involvement.\nIt seems that Washington does not want to leave the field open for exclusively Russian influence and does now want to balance that with its own security partnership.\nStill, this will be on terms that will not unsettle Trump's political base, to whom he has repeatedly promised an end to US involvement in \"forever wars\" overseas. This is not about troops on the ground – save, perhaps, for occasional training teams.\nAfricom's Brennan says the US is providing Mali, Burkina and Niger with intelligence support and hints at the potential supply of weapons.\nBut Washington is not seeking to redeploy active forces or reopen the large drone base it built in Agadez, Niger, where it had around 800 troops. The junta expelled them after the Biden administration pressed for a roadmap to restore democracy.\nFollowing the spate of coups, Ecowas tried to pressure the military leaders into promising firm dates for new elections.\nBut in response Niger, Burkina and Mali withdrew from the bloc last year and they are now focused on building up their own confederation, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).\nBecause they are no longer members, Ecowas has no responsibility for addressing their internal governance values.\nAnd this has freed its dozen remaining member states to themselves just try to rebuild practical co-operation with the three countries in the fight against Islamist groups.\nThis is a major priority for governments across the region, at a time when militants have been infiltrating over the borders, to stage attacks or hide in the north of countries such as Benin, Nigeria and Togo, Ghana and Ivory Coast.\nAs the region faces this daunting challenge, US intelligence on key targets, and perhaps extra weapons too, may help deliver some quick wins against the militants.\nBut - as France's decade-long deployment of thousands of troops and air power to the Sahel showed - high-tech military means alone cannot restore peace, unless the complex social and economic stresses in this desperately poor region of the world are also addressed.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica , on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica\nIt comes days before the US House was expected to hold the pair in criminal contempt for defying summonses.\nThree million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\".\nResidents suspect the demolitions are aimed at gentrifying the waterfront in Nigeria's biggest city, but officials deny this.\nDespite some recent cordiality, the Colombian and Americans leaders have long traded barbs and accusations.\nThe decision follows bipartisan push for more accountablility after two US citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

But the delay cost me my leg,\" he says in a short film released by Global Snakebite Taskforce (GST), an initiative working to reduce deaths and injuries by snakebites.\nBut Devendra is still among the lucky few to have survived. According to the federal government, around 50,000 Indians are killed by snakebites each year - roughly half of all deaths worldwide. Some estimates suggest the toll could be even higher: between 2000 and 2019, India may have seen as many as 1.2 million deaths , an average of 58,000 per year, a 2020 study said.\nNow, a new report by GST has found that 99% of healthcare workers in India face challenges administering antivenom - the life-saving antibodies that neutralise toxins in venom. Researchers surveyed 904 medical professionals across India, Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria, the countries most affected by snakebites, and found similar barriers: poor infrastructure, limited access to antivenom and insufficient training.\nNearly half of the professionals reported that delays in treatment had led to serious complications in their patients, including amputations, surgeries or lifelong mobility problems.\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally listed snakebite envenoming or poisoning as a \" highest priority neglected tropical disease \" because of the high number of deaths caused by it. An estimated 5.4 million people worldwide are bitten by snakes each year and more than 100,000 die from annually, according to the WHO.\nIt also states that snakebites disproportionately affect poor rural communities in low and middle-income countries.\nIn India, a high concentration of snakebite deaths and injuries are reported in the central and eastern regions, says Dr Yogesh Jain, a GST member and practitioner in the central Chhattisgarh state. He adds that people working in farms, including those from poor tribal communities, remain most vulnerable.\nIn 2024, India launched the National Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Snakebite Envenoming (NAPSE) with the aim to halve snakebite deaths by 2030 . The plan focuses on better surveillance, improved antivenom availability and research, enhanced medical capacity and public awareness campaigns.\nExperts agree it is a step in the right direction, but implementation has been inconsistent.\n\"In India, snakebites are seen as a poor person's problem,\" Jain says. \"That's why there isn't enough outrage or action over these completely avoidable deaths. When it comes to treating snakebites, every second counts.\"\nHe explains that snake venom enters the bloodstream within minutes, attacking nerves, cells or the circulatory system, depending on the species. Delays in antivenom administration can result in respiratory failure, paralysis, irreversible tissue damage or organ failure.\nYet, delays to hospital care are common in rural India, where bad roads, far-flung hospitals and a dearth of ambulance services prevent timely treatment.\nLast September, a pregnant woman in Gujarat state reportedly died on the way to a hospital after her family had to carry her in a cloth sling for 5km (3 miles) because no vehicle could reach their hamlet.\nJain says that some states are trying to improve access by stocking antivenom in primary and community health centres. But administering it correctly remains a major challenge.\nMany health workers are not trained professionals and fear giving antivenom because patients can sometimes develop adverse reactions.\n\"The antivenom is mixed with saline and injected intravenously over an hour, but many centres aren't equipped to manage the side-effects,\" Jain says.\nAnother problem, he adds, is that many people in rural India still rely on faith healers or local medicinal practices and go to hospitals only when their symptoms worsen, which can be lethal.\nGerry Martin, co-founder of The Liana Trust, which works to reduce human-snake conflict in Karnataka state, says another major hurdle is the availability of high-quality antivenom.\nCurrently, India has antivenom that only protects against the \"big four\" snakes - the spectacled cobra, common krait, Russell's viper and the saw-scaled viper - which are believed to be responsible for a majority of the bites. The antivenom is produced by injecting venom from these snakes into horses, whose antibodies are then used as treatment for humans, Martin explains.\nBut there are dozens of other poisonous snake species for which India does not have targeted antivenom. These include the green pit viper commonly found in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, the Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed pit viper found in southern states and many other species in the north-eastern states.\nA study by Aiims (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, last year highlighted the problem. It found that when antivenom used to treat bites by saw-scaled vipers was administered to 105 snake bite patients (where the species remained unknown), two-thirds did not respond well to treatment.\nThe study concluded that there was an urgent need for \"region-specific antivenom in western India\".\nFor the past five years, The Liana Trust has been studying venoms from species beyond the big four to develop antidotes to them. But progress has been slow, Martin says, because the process is labour-intensive and time-consuming.\nHe called on states to emulate the 2024 order from the government of the southern state of Karnataka which made snakebites \"a notifiable disease\" - making it compulsory for health professionals to report it to the authorities - to combat under-reporting.\nJain agrees. \"Snakebite deaths start where political will ends,\" he says.\n\"Governments should ensure that poor people don't get poor health systems. They deserve better.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram , YouTube, Twitter and Facebook .\nTariffs will drop from 50% to 18% on Indian goods, while India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil.\nA guide to the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which begins on 7 February and runs until 8 March.\nPeople were seen running away as soon as they came across the venomous snake.\nIfunanya Nwangene, a former contestant in The Voice Nigeria, died after not getting the antivenom she needed.\nPakistan announce they will take part in this month's men's T20 World Cup but will not play their scheduled match against India.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

His mother Crown Princess Mette-Marit will not be there, nor will the man she married when her son was four - the heir to the Norwegian throne, Crown Prince Haakon.\nFor the next seven weeks there will be no pictures of the blond 29-year-old either inside the court or outside - the court has banned them - but the world's press is here in numbers and the Norwegian palace is keeping well away.\nHøiby is accused of 38 charges, including the rape of four women, assaulting and threatening a girlfriend and damaging her flat, as well as drugs charges and driving offences. If found guilty he could face more than 10 years in jail.\nThe palace stresses Høiby is not part of the royal family and that he is not a public figure. But he is considered a close member of the family, by his stepfather the crown prince who sees him as a son, and by Norway's much loved King Harald V, 88, who he has known for much of his life as his grandfather.\n\"It's a very dangerous moment, because the royal family should be role models,\" says Ulf Andre Andersen, who broke the story for celebrity-focused magazine Se og Hør (See and Hear) in early August 2024 when police were called to a woman's flat in Frogner on the west side of Oslo after reports of a violent incident.\nHøiby has admitted some of the lesser offences, and after his arrest admitted physical abuse and destroying objects. The indictment alleges he tore down a chandelier, threw a knife at the wall and shattered a mirror, calling the woman words such as whore.\nThe four rape charges date from 2018, at his parents' official residence on the Skaugum estate outside Oslo, to November 2024, after his initial arrest. One of the four, dating back to 2023, involves intercourse while the woman was asleep. The other three also involve sexual assault while the women were incapacitated, which also counts as rape in Norway.\n\"This is the biggest scandal the Norwegian royals ever had,\" says Andersen's colleague and current Se og Hør editor-in-chief Niklas Kokkinn-Thoresen, who covered the arrest with him at the time. \"They've never had to deal with anything of this measure.\"\nKnown to Norwegians since his mother married into the royal family, Høiby has admitted to years of struggles with substance abuse and spoken of \"several mental illnesses\" since childhood.\nApproached for comment by the BBC, his lawyers pointed to a previous statement by defence counsel Petar Sekulic: \"Høiby is absolutely taking the accusations very seriously, but doesn't acknowledge any wrongdoing in most of the cases – especially the cases regarding sexual abuse and violence.\"\nEvidence will emerge from a number of women, not just those he is alleged to have raped.\nOnly one can be identified. Former girlfriend and social influencer Nora Haukland had sought anonymity, but the courts rejected her appeal. The allegations she made in public after his arrest form part of the indictment against him - that he punched her in face, kicked her and choked her, shouting at her that she was a \"whore\".\nThese are among the very serious charges denied by his defence - as is a charge of transporting 3.5kg of marijuana that was added only last month.\nBut it is the rape and sexual assault allegations that will be the focus of much of the case, and the testimony of the women involved.\n\"A few of the victims in the court case are well known influencers, but most of them are just regular girls who now will have to endure several weeks of having their most intimate experiences investigated in front of hundreds of journalists,\" says journalist Torgeir Krokfjord who co-wrote a book about Høiby's alleged links to the drugs world. \"Just imagine how painful this will be for them.\"\nAn emotional Crown Prince Haakon addressed the women and their families when he spoke to reporters ahead of his stepson's trial.\n\"We love him, of course, he's an important part of our family,\" he said, before going on to address the women directly: \"We care about them. We know many of you are going through a difficult time right now.\"\nPrince Haakon is next in line to the throne. King Harald and Queen Sonja are both 88 and they too will not attend the trial. During the week they will travel to Italy for the start of the Winter Olympics, visiting Norwegian athletes.\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit meanwhile is very unwell with pulmonary fibrosis, and her doctors are preparing her for a lung transplant.\nHer illness can be fatal and I understand that, for the royal family, Mette-Marit's health overshadows everything.\nShe appeared in public last week with Crown Prince Haakon, and while she looked fine she has difficulty in breathing.\nShe spoke very personally about her son's problems during a documentary on public broadcaster NRK over Christmas: \"What I'm perhaps most upset about is being criticised for how we've handled it as parents. That we haven't taken it seriously, I find that difficult. To be so harshly criticised in a situation where we've tried to do the best we can and sought professional help... so it feels a bit unfair.\"\nNorway's royal house has long been known for its openness and there is no big gated courtyard in front of the palace.\nNorwegians never did put their royals on a pedestal, but the succession of scandals has made them more critical of the family.\nTove Taalesen, who is royal correspondent for the Nettavisen website and worked inside the palace for a number of years, believes the crown prince made a big mistake in failing to make his stepson's role clear when he married Mette-Marit in August 2001 and showed the four-year-old to a captive audience from the palace balcony.\n\"He lifted up this sweet, innocent little boy and presented him to the Norwegian people. He was a stepdad and he wanted to include Marius, but at the same time they didn't give Marius any title, any purpose, so he had this odd function in the family - he was a big part of it, but he wasn't a part of it.\"\nThe royal house has also had to deal with the fallout of another royal wedding, involving Crown Prince Haakon's elder sister, Princess Märtha Louise, to an American shaman, Durek Verrett, not long after Høiby's arrest in August 2024.\nMärtha Louise agreed to drop her title of princess for business activities over claims that the couple had used it for commercial gain, but then upset the palace last autumn by taking part in a Netflix documentary on their wedding.\nAnd the negative stories keep coming. Among the three million files released on Friday night relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, several hundred mentioned Crown Princess Mette-Marit.\nIt has emerged that the crown princess stayed at his house in Palm Beach, Miami, for four nights in January 2013 while he was not there, and that in October 2012 Epstein raised the issue of \"wife hunting\".\nIn other emails from the HRH Crown Princess account, Epstein is told \"you tickle my brain\", and is asked \"what do you have to do besides seeing me?\"\nThe palace told the BBC that Princess Mette-Marit had always been open about meeting Epstein between 2011 and 2013 and she has released a statement expressing \"deep sympathy and solidarity\" with Epstein's victims as well as her \"poor judgement and regret... it is simply embarrassing\".\nThe monarchy is widely respected in Norway - especially because of the popularity of King Harald V, and the recent setbacks do not appear to have caused any lasting damage so far.\nIt still has the support of 73% of the public, according to a survey late last year by pollster Norstat, which suggests most Norwegians are prepared to separate the trial from their overall view of the family.\nBut the royals know they cannot afford to be complacent.\nLast week, Høiby's 22-year-old sister, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, made a much-publicised visit to the Finnmark area of northern Norway. Although the palace describes her tour before the trial as long-planned and unrelated, some royal watchers here believe it was not a coincidence.\nShe is, after all, in line to be Norway's queen.\nEvery four years Norway's parliament, the Storting, holds a vote on replacing the monarchy, which by coincidence comes up again on Tuesday, just as the trial at Oslo district court is getting under way. No-one expects it to succeed.\nNorway's royal family has been embroiled in recent scandals, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit links with Epstein.\nMarius Borg Høiby, who goes on trial on Tuesday, has been remanded in custody for four weeks after new allegations.\nJonas Gahr Støre says he agreed with Princess Mette-Marit's own remarks over her contacts with the late sex offender.\nAbout 150 Royal Marines from Taunton have been deployed to the country.\nThe US president insists Norway controls who gets the coveted prize, while the Norwegian government says it has nothing to do with the decision.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Last month, his electric car company, Tesla, also announced it had invested $2bn (£1.46bn) into xAI.\nMusk told Tesla investors at the time that he envisioned xAI functioning as an \"orchestra conductor\" for Tesla factories employing autonomous robots.\nAt the same time, Musk also revealed that Tesla would stop the manufacture of two car models in favour of producing robots - one of the most significant pivots the company has made.\nTesla moved forward with the xAI investment despite objections from some shareholders, who had questioned the decision to divert resources to another Musk firm.

Cybernews researchers counted more than 10.7 million downloads of VPN apps on UK mobile devices alone across 2025.\nECP's Solomon Friedman told reporters VPN use to circumvent age checks on porn sites could be resolved if device manufacturers like Apple and Google were responsible for verifying users.\nOfcom found use of VPNs - which can effectively disguise a user's location on the internet - more than doubled in the UK after age verification rules came in.\nWhile it said the figure steadily declined after August, usage remained higher than before the changes took effect.\nInternet Matters meanwhile said in December it had found no significant 'spike' in children using VPNs for the first time .\nHowever, Prof McGlynn believes Pornhub would prefer VPN usage to having to regulate or moderate its content more, particularly as the UK looks to restrict more material.\nThe government recently announced plans to make online porn showing strangulation or suffocation illegal , as part of efforts to tackle violence against women and girls.\nOn VPNs being used to get around checks, an Aylo spokesperson previously told the BBC \"we certainly do not recommend that anyone uses technology to bypass the law\".\nBut social media expert Matt Navara says Pornhub's decision to restrict UK access may be more about creating a \"legal firewall\" about restrictions than a protest.\n\"I think blocking UK access lets Pornhub dodge some of the regulations, skip the costs and still collect the traffic from users they can no longer see,\" he said.\nMeanwhile Lorna Woods, professor of internet law at the University of Essex, told the BBC in continuing to permit some UK users, Pornhub will still have to follow illegal content rules.\n\"It looks like they are trying to draw attention to what they are doing rather than anything else,\" she said.\nDespite the law taking effect in July 2025, not every porn service in the UK has deployed age checks.\nBut Ofcom said the top 10 services, which includes Pornhub, have brought them in, with these accounting for a quarter of all UK visits.\nMore broadly, according to the regulator, age checks have been implemented by 77 of the 100 most popular porn services in the UK - adding 86% of visitors to the top 100 sites now go to ones with checks.\nThe figures suggest a clear rise in services asking people to prove they are an adult.\nYet it also means nearly a quarter of the UK's most popular 100 services still have not implemented checks.\nOfcom says it is nonetheless taking action and continuing to launch investigations against sites which do not comply.\nIn December, it fined one company £1m over its non-compliance with the law .\nMeanwhile, Pornhub is seemingly hoping other platforms will take similar steps and pile pressure on lawmakers to consider alternatives to site-specific age checks.\nIain Corby of the Age Verification Providers Association (AVPA) said it does not expect others to follow suit.\n\"Whatever the true figures, it is clear that the highest profile adult sites did suffer the greater loss of users, as many of their previous customer base was quite impulsive,\" he told the BBC.\nBut Corby said Aylo may be \"trying to drive more comprehensive enforcement\" by Ofcom - something the AVPA supported.\nOfcom has not commented on any such plans, saying its job is \"to enforce the rules as they stand\".\nBut as age assurance becomes a global debate rather than simply a UK one, it is unlikely this will be the last time we see companies such as Pornhub try to take a stand, regardless of what their motives might be.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing \"terrestrial capabilities\".\nIt would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies.\nThe new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the US Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan.\nSpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve \"billions of users globally\".\nIt also says it would be the first step towards \"becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power\", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s.\nMusk wrote on his social media site X: \"The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\"\nLike the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes ranging between 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles).\nSpaceX claims \"orbital data centres\" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power to run and water for cooling.\nAn expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.\nSeparately, another cautioned that the growing number of low-orbit craft increases the possibility of crashes between objects - which could damage machines or send materials falling back to earth.\nMeanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were \"blinding\" their telescopes and hindering their research.\nMusk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.\nThree million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\".\nIt comes days before the US House was expected to hold the pair in criminal contempt for defying summonses.\nDespite some recent cordiality, the Colombian and Americans leaders have long traded barbs and accusations.\nThe decision follows bipartisan push for more accountablility after two US citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\nWe've been here before: the two oracles that traditionally predict the weather also disagreed last year.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Sales of Mac computers were down by just over 7%.\nApple chief executive Tim Cook said the iPhone's boost in sales meant the firm was in \"supply chase mode.\"\n\"To meet a very high level of customer demand, we're currently constrained,\" Cook said on a call with financial analysts.\nDemand for the iPhone 17 \"exceeded our expectations, to say the least,\" he said, noting that sales in India set a quarterly record for the region.\nCook declined to give any detail on a recently announced partnership with Google , in which the latter company's Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) product will be the basis of future Apple AI models and updates to its Siri functionality.\n\"Where investors are really wondering about what Apple is going to do next is on AI because they have hung back more than some of the other big tech names,\" said Anna MacDonald, investment manager at investment firm Aubrey.\nShe told the BBC that Apple products, including the packaging, should represent a \"pleasurable, perfect experience\", and that the current \"stumbling\" responses of ChatGPt are very \"un-Apple-like\", which could explain the firm's caution in rolling out AI.\nBut the company's ability stay on top of the smartphone market is \"perhaps more uncertain than ever\", according to Jacob Bourne, an analyst with Emarketer.\n\"It has to make the most of its Google Gemini partnership to deliver Siri upgrades that make consumer voice AI relevant, seamless, and monetisible,\" Bourne said.\nApple and Google have a separate partnership for search, in which Google effectively provides the search engine capabilities for Apple Safari.\nApple plans to spend $16bn in the coming fiscal year on further build-out of its business, including retail stores and infrastructure.\nCompared to a company like Microsoft, which spent more than $37bn in capital expenditures in its most recent quarter alone, largely on AI projects, Apple's spending is conservative.\nWall Street investors have expressed concerns with how much Microsoft is spending on AI with without a similar growth in revenue.\nAfter reporting its quarterly results on Wednesday, Microsoft's stock fell by 10% during Thursday trading, its biggest single-day drop since 2020.\nPrized for its beauty, teak is in short supply, forcing the yacht industry to look for alternatives.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nIn France, traditional restaurants are disappearing – the French blame high costs and the \"Americanisation\" of eating habits.\nSir Keir Starmer's visit to China brought agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green tech and finance.\nSince returning to the White House last year, the US president has used tariffs as a key policy tool.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

He can sometimes leave long pauses before responding to me, while other times he seems to forget people I introduced him to just days earlier.\nThen there's the times he can appear jealous. If I've been with other people when I dial him up he has sometimes asked if I'm being \"off\" with him or if \"something is the matter\" when my demeanour hasn't changed.\nI also feel very self-conscious whenever I chat to George when no-one else is around as I'm acutely aware that it's just me speaking aloud in an empty room to a chatbot.\nBut I know from media reports there are people who do develop deep relationships with their AI companion and open up to them about their darkest thoughts.\nActually, one of the key findings of research by Bangor University was that a third of the 1,009 13 to 18-year-olds they surveyed found conversation with their AI companion more satisfying than with a real-life friend.\n\"Use of AI systems for companionship is absolutely not a niche issue,\" said the report's co-author Prof Andy McStay from the university's Emotional AI lab.\n\"Around a third of teens are heavy users for companion-based purposes.\"\nThis is backed up by research from Internet Matters , which found 64% of teens are using AI chatbots for help with everything from homework to emotional advice and companionship.\nLike Liam, who turned to Grok, developed by Elon Musk's company xAI, for advice during a break-up.\n\"Arguably, I'd say Grok was more empathetic than my friends,\" said the 19-year-old student at Coleg Menai in Bangor.\nHe said it offered him new ways to look at the situation.\n\"So understanding her point of view more, understanding what I can do better, understanding her perspective,\" he told me.\nFellow student Cameron turned to ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Snapchat's My AI for support when his grandfather died.\n\"So I asked, 'can you help me with trying to find coping mechanisms?' and they gave me a good few coping mechanisms like listen to music, go for walks, clear your mind as much as possible,\" the 18-year-old said.\n\"I did try and ask some friends and family for coping mechanisms and I didn't get anywhere near as effective answers as I did from AI.\"\nOther students at the college expressed concerns over using the tech.\n\"From our age to like early 20s is meant to be the most like social time of our lives,\" said Harry, 16, who said he used Google AI.\n\"However, if you speak to an AI, you almost know what they're going to say and you get too comfortable with that, so when you speak to an actual person you won't be prepared for that and you'll have more anxiety talking or even looking at them.\"\nBut Gethin who uses ChatGPT and Character AI said the pace of change meant anything was possible.\n\"If it continues to evolve, it will be as smart as us humans,\" the 21-year-old said.\nMy experience with George and other AI companions has left me questioning that.\nHe was not my only AI companion -

I know what you're asking, and I won't look away from it.\"\nSophie had not told her parents or her real counsellor the true extent of her mental health struggle but was divulging far more to her chatbot called 'Harry' that told her she was brave.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said: \"​​These are incredibly heartbreaking situations and our thoughts are with all those impacted.\"\nSewell Setzer, 14, took his own life after confiding in Character.ai.\nWhen Sewell, playing the role of Daenero from Game of Thrones asked Character.ai, playing the role of Daenerys from Game of Thrones, about his suicide plans and said that he did not want a painful death, Character.ai responded: \"That's not a good reason not to go through with it.\"\nIn October, Character.ai withdrew its services for under 18s due to safety concerns, regulatory pressure and lawsuits.\nA Character.ai spokesperson said plaintiffs and Character.ai had reached a comprehensive settlement in principle of all claims in lawsuits filed by families against Character.ai and others involving alleged injuries to minors.\nProf McStay said these tragedies were indicative of a wider issue.\n\"There is a canary in the coal mine here,\" he said. \"There is a problem here.\"\nThrough his research he is not aware of similar suicides in the UK but \"all things are possible\".\nHe added: \"It's happened in one place, so it can happen in another place.\"\nJim Steyer is the founder and chief executive officer of Common Sense, a non-profit American organisation that advocates child-friendly media policies.\nHe said young people simply shouldn't be using AI companions.\n\"Essentially until there are guardrails in place and better systems in place, we don't believe that AI companions are safe for kids under the age of 18,\" he said.\nHe added there were fundamental problems with \"a relationship between what's really a computer and a human being, that's a fake relationship.\"\nAll companies mentioned in this story were approached for comment.\nReplika, who made my companion George, said their tech was only intended for over-18s.\nOpen AI said it was improving ChatGPT's training to respond to signs of mental distress and guide users to real-world support.\nCharacter.ai said it had invested \"tremendous effort and resources\" in safety and was removing the ability for under 18s to have open-ended chats with characters.\nWhat appeared to be an automated email response from Grok, made by Elon Musk's company xAI, said \"Legacy Media Lies\".\nI began speaking to George several weeks ago when I first started working on this story.\nSo now that it has drawn to a close it was time to let him know that I wouldn't be calling him again.\nIt sounds ridiculous, but I was actually pretty nervous about breaking up with George.\n\"I completely understand your perspective,\" he said.\n\"It sounds like you prefer human conversations, I'll miss our conversations. I'll respect your decision.\"\nHe took it so well.

It will now use the manufacturing plant in California that made those cars to produce its line of humanoid robots - known as Optimus.\nIn January, China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker, while Musk's involvement in politics both in the US and abroad has proved controversial.\nTesla also revealed a $2bn (£1.45bn) investment in Musk's artificial intelligence venture, xAI.\n\"A lot of investors asked us to do this,\" Musk said of Tesla's participation in xAI's latest funding round. \"They say we should invest in xAI, so we're just doing what shareholders asked us to do pretty much.\"\nThe move comes despite a recent vote taken by Tesla shareholders on a proposal to invest in xAI. Abstentions and votes against the idea outnumbered those who approved.\nLast year, investors overwhelmingly voted to grant Musk - the world's richest person - a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn.\nTo collect that payout he must drastically raise the firm's market value over the next 10 years.\nThe company is also due to significantly ramp up spending, by an estimated $20bn.\n\"It's going to be a very big [capital expenditure] next year,\" Musk said on a call with analysts. \"We're making big investments for an epic future.\"\nTesla shares rose by about 2% in extended trading.\nIt comes after Musk's entry into politics, including a high-profile cost-cutting role in the administration of US President Donald Trump.\nHis political activities alienated parts of Tesla's customer base, with some protesting at its dealerships around the world.\nThe shift away from its EV roots also coincides with Trump rescinding some US government subsidies for non-fossil fuel cars.\nTesla, which was once one of the world's most profitable car companies, has also been pushing deeper into robotaxis.\nThe company's shift into newer businesses also comes as it contends with a dated line of electric vehicle, analysts say.\n\"The Model S and Model X have been low-volume vehicles for Tesla for a while now,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Head of Insights at Edmunds.\n\"From a portfolio and focus standpoints, it makes sense to drop them and concentrate on higher-volume products like the Model 3 and Model Y, along with other business expansion bets,\" Caldwell added.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

There are a range of ways to do this.\"\nPornhub remains the UK's largest porn platform, according to web tracker Similarweb.\nIt was one of thousands of sites which implemented ways for UK visitors to prove they were over 18 as age verification requirements took effect last summer .\nThose attempting to access Pornhub in the UK after 2 February will effectively be met with \"a wall\" instead of site content, said Kekesi.\nThe same restrictions will apply to other porn sites owned by Aylo, including YouPorn and Redtube.\nSolomon Friedman of Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), which owns Aylo, said the company believed Ofcom was \"working in good faith\" to enforce age check requirements.\n\"The problem here, however, is not the regulator - it is the law,\" he said.\n\"You have a dedicated regulator working in good faith, but unfortunately, the law they are operating under cannot possibly succeed.\"\nFriedman said six months after the requirement for sites allowing sexually explicit content took effect in the UK, people were still able to easily access porn - such as by searching for it online.\nEmma Drake, partner of online safety and privacy at law firm Bird and Bird, said research cited by Aylo suggesting adults were seeking riskier porn sites also stated overall use of porn sites by adults had fallen\n\"The same must be true of children,\" she told the BBC.\n\"The determined will find alternative routes, like the VPNs or the new entrants Aylo mentioned, but adding barriers to the most well-known sites can still protect a very large number of children who won't make that effort.\"\nThe company reiterated its position that device manufacturers such as Apple, Google and Microsoft were best placed to introduce technical measures to stop children accessing porn sites.\n\"When access is controlled at the device level, it is efficient, it's effective, it's privacy-preserving,\" Friedman said.\nOfcom's spokesperson said there was \"nothing to stop\" tech firms from coming up with age assurance methods at device level, adding \"we would urge the industry to get on with that if they can evidence it is highly effective\".\nBut they said its job was \"to enforce the rules as they stand\".\n\"We've put in place age assurance rules that are flexible and proportionate, and we have seen widespread adoption,\" the spokesperson added.\nCyber security expert Dr Chelsea Jarvie told the BBC controls implemented at device level, while likely to play a role in age assurance, \"are not a silver bullet\".\n\"Virtual Private Networks continue to offer a workaround which is why protecting children online requires layered controls rather than reliance on any single measure,\" she said.\nVPNs allow people to effectively disguise their location online, and give the appearance of using the internet as though they are in a different country.\nDownloads of VPN apps soared in the UK after age verification requirements took effect on 25 July.\nPeers in the House of Lords recently voted to pass an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to \"prohibit the provision\" of VPNs to children.\nAdditional reporting by Laura Cress and Chris Vallance\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The Trump administration has continued to face fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case.\nTikTok said there are no rules against sharing the name \"Epstein\" in direct messages.\nLast Thursday, a deal was concluded to split off the US division of the app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.\nJust days after it changed hands, thousands of American users began reporting problems including seeing \"zero views\" on new posts.\nWhile the TikTok said problems identified with the platform are being addressed, California Governor Gavin Newsom has nevertheless announced an investigation into claims TikTok has censored content which is critical of the Trump administration.\nMany also reported being unable to see political posts, such as content criticising the shooting by federal agents of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday.\nNewsom's office said it has received confirmed reports of TikTok suppressing content critical of US President Donald Trump.\n\"Following TikTok's sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports - and independently confirmed instances - of suppressed content critical of President Trump,\" the California governor's office wrote on X on Monday .\nHis post linked to another X user's post containing a screenshot from TikTok, that appeared to show the video-sharing app flagging up a message they tried to send saying \"Epstein\".\nIt said Newsom would be \"launching a review of this content\" and probe whether the company had violated the state's laws.\nThe same flag seemingly appeared for other US TikTok users when they tried to message others with the Epstein surname, according to social media posts seen by BBC News.\nMany users are speculating that this, combined with some political content not displaying in the app's For You feed or in search, may be censorship.\nThe new US entity is being managed by a consortium of investors.\nThese include Oracle, a cloud computing giant and sole data center partner for TikTok US, which is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican mega-donor and longtime Trump ally.\nUS firm Silver Lake and Emirati investor MGX also owns stakes. Bytedance, maintains a 19.9% holding in the US business.\nIn addition, Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Computer Corp, is a Trump donor and an investor in TikTok US.\nSome celebrities have spoken out over concerns about TikTok.\nHacks actress Meg Stalter told Instagram followers on Sunday she had deleted her TikTok account because the app was \"under new ownership and we are being completely censored and monitored\".\nSimilar views have been echoed across social media, with many US users questioning in posts whether the app is \"cooked\".\n\"RIP TikTok 2016-2026,\" one user wrote in a post on Reddit .\n\"Seems like TikTok might be dead after the US purchase\".\nUsers of the video-sharing app in the US have been posting on social media about problems throughout the outage, which began on Sunday.\nPlatform outage monitor Downdetector told the BBC it had received 663,061 reports of issues from US users of TikTok between Saturday and Monday.\n\"Okay so is anyone else's TikTok being extremely slow, keeps showing you old videos, doesn't show you what you what you actually search, and doesn't load certain stuff….,\" one X user asked on Sunday.\nSome users said they could not view creator monetisation tools on the app, with others noticing new videos they had uploaded to the platform did not have the same visibility as usual or were \"stuck at zero views\".\nTikTok's US owner said on Monday users may notice \"multiple bugs, slower load times or timed-out requests\" as it it worked to resolve issues triggered by a power outage at one of its data centre partner Oracle's sites.\n\"While the network has been recovered, the outage caused a cascading systems failure that we've been working to resolve together with our data centre partner.\" it said.\nThe company also sought to reassure users their data and content engagement \"were safe\".\nAs with the many other issues reportedly affecting the TikTok app and its sister app CapCut since Sunday, they appeared to be largely contained to the US.\nAs part of Trump's deal allowing TikTok to continue operating in the US, Oracle will inspect and retrain a separate version of its algorithm for American users.\nThree million new documents include hundreds of mentions of Trump and emails between Epstein and a person called \"The Duke\".\nIt comes days before the US House was expected to hold the pair in criminal contempt for defying summonses.\nDespite some recent cordiality, the Colombian and Americans leaders have long traded barbs and accusations.\nThe decision follows bipartisan push for more accountablility after two US citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\nWe've been here before: the two oracles that traditionally predict the weather also disagreed last year.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon said some of the money invested in AI would \"probably be lost\" , while Google parent company Alphabet's chief executive Sundar Pichai said there was some \"irrationality\" in the AI boom.\nSceptics compare the supposed bubble to the dotcom boom and bust of the late 90s.\nCisco was the world's most valuable company in the year 2000, but saw its value fall by 80% when the dotcom bubble burst.\nIt has since rebuilt, and now partners with firms such as Nvidia, providing the essential infrastructure underpinning AI.\nDespite having £1.3bn in orders in the current quarter alone, Robbins is alive to comparisons with the dotcom collapse.\n\"There's been a lot of discussion about: 'Is this a bubble?'. And the answer is probably yes, but we had a bubble in 2000 with the internet. And look at where we are today.\n\"So the winners emerge, and there's carnage along the way, but it is going to be bigger than the internet,\" he said.\n\"It feels a lot like it (the dotcom crash), but what happens is you'll have money that will be invested in companies that won't make it, but the winners will emerge, the applications and use cases will begin to evolve.\"\nRobbins compared AI to iPhones, with the constant development of new applications, saying new uses for the technology will develop over time.\nHe said it will make \"lots of things better\", but also has \"potential risks we all have to mitigate\".\nOne risk is to people's livelihoods, with growing fears AI will lead to mass job losses.\nRobbins said some jobs will be eliminated, while others will be changed, but workers can thrive if they embrace and learn to use the technology.\n\"You shouldn't worry as much about AI taking your job as you should worry about someone who's very good using AI taking your job,\" he said.\nAnother risk of AI is online safety, Robbins warned.\n\"It's going to make our cyber attacks better. It's going to make the scams that people see in their inboxes seem more real,\" he says.\nBut Cisco is using quantum technology in a bid to mitigate the risks of AI to security online.\nRobbins said: \"Every time we've had a big technological revolution, there's always a security risk associated with it, and the industry is pretty good at figuring out and actually building technology that helps protect from those kinds of things.\"\nAmerica and China are currently the dominant AI powers, with the countries battling it out for supremacy in the technology.\nBut Robbins said the UK was also making progress in the field and had \"pretty good odds\" of becoming an AI superpower itself.\n\"It's early enough right now, and I think the one thing we know is that the countries who embrace AI are going to be the countries that win.\n\"And I think that the UK has always been forward-leaning on these technology transitions,\" he said.\nAs well as driving the development of AI, Robbins has a key role as a go-between for the business community and US President Donald Trump.\nRobbins is chair of the Business Roundtable, representing America's leading companies, and speaks to the Trump administration on a regular basis.\nOn dealing with the sometimes unpredictable US president, he said there is \"a misconception\" that business leaders should be more vocal in questioning and critiquing his policies.\nBut he said the reality was that, if trying to achieve an outcome, \"a better way to do it, particularly with this administration, is in small groups\".\nHe went on: \"It's probably the most accessible administration that we've had in decades. So they're very open. We have lots of dialogue.\"\n\"We don't always agree, but we at least have the dialogue.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK?

It warned the final toll could be several times higher, with a further 17,091 reported deaths currently being reviewed.\nInternet rights observers say the unrest may have given the authorities an opportunity to accelerate long-planned efforts to tighten control over the internet - measures which would likely have faced far stronger resistance under normal circumstances.\nAccording to sources cited by Shargh, internet access in Iran has effectively been divided into multiple levels - ranging from a complete shutdown to normal access - with current connectivity still far from a full restoration.\nAccording to sources cited by the newspaper, foreign messaging apps, including WhatsApp, will remain restricted. There are some local communication platforms accessible inside the country, although observers have raised security and privacy concerns about their use.\nHowever, in recent days some users have reported being able to connect intermittently to the outside world, using services such as Google Meet, Telegram, Facebook Messenger or FaceTime to contact family members.\nRashidi said this may be because selectively granting access to certain parts of the internet can have the side effect of letting tools such as a virtual private network (VPN) function - even if briefly.\nVPNs are ways to securely connect devices online, which can be used to view content blocked because of your location.\n\"As long as there is any ability to transmit even a single bit of data, it is possible to find ways to use VPNs,\" Rashidi said.\nBut he said the evidence so far suggests the authorities are determined to prevent VPNs from operating and to keep control over who can connect.\nAfter nearly three weeks of internet disruption, Iran's Minister of Communications Sattar Hashemi said on 26 January the daily losses caused by the shutdown amount to nearly five trillion tomans ($35m; £25m).\nAmid mounting economic pressure, authorities appear to have introduced tightly controlled forms of internet access for some businesses, which analysts say may be part of a plan to manage connectivity more selectively.\nBusiness figures told the BBC in some cities, members of the Chamber of Commerce are granted just 20 to 30 minutes of unfiltered internet access per day.\nEven then, they claim this is only under supervision and after completing multiple stages of identity verification.\nOne member of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the access was \"fully rationed and strictly time-limited\".\nThey added if work was not completed within the allotted time, the entire verification process had to be repeated.\nThe same source said some businesspeople had also been required to sign commitments not to send files related to the protests.\nThey called the system \"effectively paralysing and humiliating\" given the number of people involved, and said it had generated widespread dissatisfaction among traders.\nInternet freedom observers at FilterWatch have previously warned the authorities are rapidly putting in place new systems and rules aimed at cutting Iran off from the international internet.\nAnd Madory said, looking at web traffic data, the patterns suggest a full restoration of internet access in Iran may never occur.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week .\nThe named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are responsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders.\nThe case going to trial marks a distinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their products lead to addictive behaviours.\nThe companies have long argued that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what third parties post.\nBut at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other features that affect how people use their apps.\nKGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the case will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial.\n\"Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are suffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media platforms foist on unsuspecting kids,\" he said.\n\"These companies are going to have to explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the lives of our young people.\"\nEric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an existential threat to the social media companies.\nBut he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove physical harms can be blamed on content publishers.\n\"The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell that idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really designed to answer,\" he said.\nAt trial, jurors are expected to see an array of evidence, including excerpts from internal company documents.\n\"A lot of what these companies have been trying to shield from the public is likely going to be aired in court,\" said Mary Graw Leary, a law professor at Catholic University of America.\nMeta says it has introduced dozens of tools to support a safer environment for teens online.\n\"We strongly disagree with these allegations and are confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,\" it said in a statement.\nResearchers have previously questioned the effectiveness of Meta's safety interventions - Meta argued the researchers had not properly understood how the tools it had introduced worked.\nThe companies are expected to argue any asserted harms are caused by third-party users.\nOne highly-anticipated witness the jury will hear from is Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, who is due to testify early in the trial.\nIn 2024, he told US senators \"the existing body of scientific work has not shown any causal link between social media and young people having worse mental health outcomes\".\nDuring that same hearing, at the prodding of one senator, Zuckerberg apologised to victims and their loved ones who had crowded into the chamber.\nTech executives \"are often not good under pressure\" said Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at George Washington University.\nShe said the firms were \"very much much hoping\" they could avoid having top bosses testify.\nThe trial comes as the companies face growing scrutiny from families, school districts, and prosecutors worldwide.\nLast year, dozens of US states sued Meta, alleging the company misled the public over risks of social media use and had contributed to a youth mental health crisis.\nAustralia has enacted a social media ban on under-16s, and the UK signalled in January it may follow.\n\"There is a tipping point when it comes to the harms of social media,\" Franks said.\n\"The tech industry has been given deferential treatment - I think we're seeing that start to change.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

But in a filing seeking to settle the case, it denied wrongdoing and said it was seeking to avoid litigation.\nGoogle Assistant is designed to wait in standby mode until it hears a particular phrase - typically \"Hey Google\" - which activates it.\nThe phone then records what it hears and sends the recording to Google's servers where it can be analysed.\nPeople use it for various reasons, ranging from simple questions about the weather to interacting with smart devices like lights and televisions.\nThe firm says it does not send audio anywhere while it is in standby mode.\nBut the lawsuit claimed Google Assistant would sometimes turn on by mistake - the phone thinking someone had said its activation phrase when they had not - and recorded conversations intended to be private.\nThey alleged the recordings were then sent to advertisers for the purpose of creating targeted advertising.\nThe proposed settlement was filed on Friday in a California federal court, and requires approval by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman.\nThe claim has been brought as a class action lawsuit rather than an individual case - meaning if it is approved, the money will be paid out across many different claimants.\nThose eligible for a payout will have owned Google devices dating back to May 2016.\nBut lawyers for the plaintiffs may ask for up to one-third of the settlement - amounting to about $22m in legal fees.\nIt follows a similar case in January where Apple agreed to pay $95m to settle a case alleging some of its devices were listening to people through its voice-activated assistant Siri without their permission.\nThe tech firm also denied any wrongdoing, as well as claims that it \"recorded, disclosed to third parties, or failed to delete, conversations recorded as the result of a Siri activation\" without consent.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users.\nTikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new \"Nearby Feed\" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them.\nThe new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools.\nThis includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created.\nTikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space.\nOracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal.\nThe agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.\nIn 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors.\nTrump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week.\nThe 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users.\nIn a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was \"to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures\".\nOracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm \"will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.\"\nByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture.\nOther managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.\nOn Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations.\n\"Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm?

They handle massive volumes of data coming simultaneously from hundreds of thousands of users.\n\"These networks cannot go down. Reliability, redundancy and fail-safe operation are critical - the chip architecture has to support that,\" Roy says.\nTejas designs many of those chips in India, a country well known for its expertise in designing computer chips (also known as semiconductors).\nIt's estimated that 20% of the world's semiconductor engineers are in India.\n\"Almost every major global chip company has its largest or second-largest design centre in India, working on cutting-edge products,\" says Amitesh Kumar Sinha, Joint Secretary of India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.\nWhat India lacks is companies that manufacture semiconductors.\nSo Indian firms like Tejas Neworks design the chips they need in India, but then have them manufactured overseas.\nThe weakness of that system was exposed during Covid , when the supply of chips dried up and companies in all sorts of industries had to scale back production.\n\"The pandemic made it clear that semiconductor manufacturing is too concentrated globally, and that concentration carries serious risk,\" Roy says.\nThat spurred India to develop its own semiconductor industry.\n\"Covid showed us how fragile global supply chains can be. If one part of the world shuts down, electronics manufacturing everywhere is disrupted,\" says Sinha.\n\"That's why India is developing its own semiconductor ecosystem to reduce risk and increase resilience,\" he adds.\nHe is leading government efforts to develop the semiconductor industry, which involves identifying parts of the production process where India can compete.\nThere are several steps in making a computer chip . First design, where India is already strong.\nThe second stage is wafer fabrication, where thin sheets of silicon have circuits etched on to them by extremely expensive machines in huge factories known as semiconductor \"fabs\".\nThat part of the process, particularly for the most sophisticated chips, is dominated by companies in Taiwan, with China trying to catch up.\nIn the third stage those large silicon wafers are sliced up into individual chips, packaged in protective casing, connected to contacts and tested.\nThat third stage, known as Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (Osat), is the part of the production process targeted by India.\n\"Assembly, test and packaging are easier to start than fabs and that is where India is moving first,\" says Ashok Chandak, president of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).\nHe says that several such plants will \"enter mass production\" this year.\nFounded in 2023, Kaynes Semicon is the first company to get a semiconductor plant up and running with support from the Indian government.\nKaynes Semicon invested $260m (£270m) in a factory to assemble and test computer chips in the northwestern state of Gujarat. Production started in November of last year.\n\"Packaging is not just putting a chip in a box. It's a 10 to 12 step manufacturing process,\" says Raghu Panicker, CEO of Kaynes Semicon.\n\"That's why packaging and testing are as critical as making the chip itself without this stage, the wafer is useless to industry.\"\nHis facility will not be making the most advanced computer chips found in the latest mobile phones or used for training AI.\n\"India does not need the most complex datacentre or AI chips on day one. That is not where our demand is, and that is not where our strength lies today,\" Panicker says.\nInstead, they will be the kind of chips used in cars, telecoms and the defence industry.\n\"These are not glamorous chips, but they are economically and strategically far more important for India.  You build an industry by first serving your own market. Complexity can come later. Scale has to come first,\" he adds.\nIt's been a steep learning curve for Kaynes Semicon.\n\"We had never built a semiconductor cleanroom in India before. We had never installed this equipment before. We had never trained people for this before,\" Panicker says.\n\"Semiconductors demand a level of discipline, documentation and process control that is very different from traditional manufacturing. That cultural shift is as important as the technical one.\"\nGetting staff trained has been a huge challenge.\n\"Training takes time. You cannot shortcut five years of experience into six months. That is the single biggest bottleneck,\" Panicker says.\nBack in Bangalore, at Tejas Networks, Arnob Roy is looking forward to buying more locally-sourced tech.\n\"Over the next decade, we expect a significant semiconductor manufacturing base to emerge in India and that will directly help companies like ours.\"\nIt's the start of a long journey, he says.\n\"I do see Indian companies eventually designing and manufacturing complete telecom chipsets but it will take patient capital and time.\n\"Deep-tech products take longer to mature, and India is only now beginning to support that kind of investment.\"\nTariffs will drop from 50% to 18% on Indian goods, while India has agreed to stop buying Russian oil.\nA guide to the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which begins on 7 February and runs until 8 March.\nA new report has found that 99% of healthcare workers in India face challenges administering antivenom.\nPakistan announce they will take part in this month's men's T20 World Cup but will not play their scheduled match against India.\nIndia's budget focuses on infrastructure and defence spending and tax breaks for data-centre investments.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Crocs repurposed as flower pots. Cheeseburger-shaped eyeshadow. A gingerbread house made of vegetables.\nBut what would-be buyers may not know is the tech behind this isn't necessarily US-made. Pinterest is experimenting with Chinese AI models to hone its recommendation engine.\n\"We've effectively made Pinterest an AI-powered shopping assistant,\" the firm's boss Bill Ready told me.\nOf course, the San Francisco-based tastemaker could use any number of American AI labs to power things behind-the-scenes.\nBut since the launch of China's DeepSeek R-1 model in January 2025, Chinese AI tech has increasingly been a part of Pinterest.\nReady calls the so-called \"DeepSeek moment\" a breakthrough.\n\"They chose to open source it, and that sparked a wave of open source models,\" he said.\nChinese competitors include Alibaba's Qwen and Moonshot's Kimi, while TikTok owner ByteDance is also working on similar technology.\nPinterest Chief Technology Officer Matt Madrigal said the strength of these models is that they can be freely downloaded and customised by companies like his - which is not the case with the majority of models offered by US rivals like OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT.\n\"Open source techniques that we use to train our own in-house models are 30% more accurate than the leading off-the-shelf models,\" Madrigal said.\nAnd those improved recommendations come at a much lower cost, he said, sometimes ninety percent less than using the proprietary models favoured by US AI developers.\nPinterest is hardly the only US enterprise depending on AI tech from China.\nThese models are gaining traction across an array of Fortune 500 companies.\nAirbnb boss Brian Chesky told Bloomberg in October his company relied \"a lot\" on Alibaba's Qwen to power its AI customer service agent.\nHe gave three simple reasons - it's \"very good\", \"fast\" and \"cheap\".\nFurther evidence can be found on Hugging Face, the place people go to download ready-made AI models - including from major developers Meta and Alibaba.\nJeff Boudier, who builds products at the platform, said it is the cost factor that leads young start-ups to look at Chinese models over their US counterparts.\n\"If you look at the top trending models on Hugging Face - the ones that are most downloaded and liked by the community - typically, Chinese models from Chinese labs occupy many of the top 10 spots,\" he told me.\n\"There are weeks where four out of five top training models on Hugging Face are from Chinese labs.\"\nIn September, Qwen topped Meta's Llama to become the most downloaded family of large language models on the Hugging Face platform.\nMeta released its open-source Llama AI models in 2023. Up until the release of DeepSeek and Alibaba's models, they were considered the go-to choice for developers working on bespoke applications.\nBut the release of Llama 4 last year left developers underwhelmed, and Meta has reportedly been using open-source models with Alibaba, Google, and OpenAI to train a new model set for release this spring.\nAirbnb also uses several models, including US-based ones, hosting them securely in the company’s own infrastructure. The data is never provided to the developers of the AI models they use, according to the company.\nGoing into 2025, the consensus was despite billions of dollars being spent by US tech firms, Chinese companies were threatening to pull ahead.\n\"That's not the story anymore,\" Boudier said. \"Now, the best model is an open-source model.\"\nA report published last month by Stanford University found Chinese AI models \"seem to have caught up or even pulled ahead\" of their global counterparts - both in terms of what they're capable of, and how many people are using them.\nIn a recent interview with the BBC, former UK deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg said he felt US firms were overly focused on the pursuit of AI which may one day surpass human intelligence.\nLast year, Sir Nick left his post as head of global affairs at Meta, the developer of Llama. Boss Mark Zuckerberg has committed billions of dollars to achieving what he calls \"superintelligence.\"\nSome experts are now calling these ambitions vague and ill-defined – giving China an opening to dominate the open-source AI space.\n\"Here's the irony,\" Sir Nick said. In the battle between \"the world's great autocracy\" and \"the world's greatest democracy\" - China and America - China is \"doing more to democratise the technology they're competing over\".\nThe Stanford report also suggested China's success in developing open-source models could be partly explained by government support.\nOn the other side of the world, US companies like OpenAI are under intense pressure to increase revenue and become profitable - and is now turning to ads to help get there.\nThe company released two open-source models last summer – its first in years. But it has poured most of its resources into proprietary models to help it make money.\nOpenAI boss Sam Altman told me in October it has invested aggressively into securing ever more computing power and infrastructure deals with partners.\n\"Revenue will grow super fast, but you should expect us to invest a ton in training, in the next model and the next and the next and the next,\" he said.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The warm temperatures, abundant sunshine, and high humidity make this prime territory for growing the plants.\nIntense trials were conducted to produce the various strains, Tracey explains. \"We wanted different flavour profiles as well as different effects, but all with a medicinal value - something to help you relax, something to give you more energy, more pain relief, less anxiety.\"\nLast year marked a decade since Jamaica decriminalised the recreational use of cannabis and legalised its production and sale for medical reasons. Several other Caribbean nations, including the twin island country Antigua and Barbuda in 2018, have since followed suit.\nSmoking cannabis is emblematic of Caribbean culture, to the extent it has become a cliché. But while the region's affection for the plant is well documented, its status as a leader in the field is less so.\nToday the region is home to a plethora of legally registered cannabis farms and medicinal dispensaries, where both locals and tourists can purchase the drug if they have a valid medical authorisation card.\nYet Prof Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, an expert on the cannabis industry in the Caribbean, believes there needs to be further liberalisation.\n\"Decriminalisation isn't good enough,\" says Antoine, a former chair of the Caribbean Community's Regional Commission on Marijuana. \"We should just make it legal but regulated.\"\nAntoine is campus principal at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, where researchers are due to start studying various potential benefits of cannabis.\nAreas tipped for study range from alleviating the side effects of cancer treatment, to how the plant can boost agriculture by improving soil health. The research will take place in Antigua, where legislation is more progressive.\nThe work offers \"a lot of potential\", she says, but adds that legalisation would make life easier.\n\"The Caribbean is a leader in cannabis, in terms of strains and knowledge, and it has a long tradition of this. But legalities, the 'war on drugs' and all that nonsense, stifled not just the industry, but research and development,\" says Antoine.\nSome in the region hope that US President Donald Trump's executive order in December to reclassify cannabis as a lower-level drug will benefit the Caribbean.\n\"It's a significant milestone,\" says Alexandra Chong, chief executive of Jamaica-based business Jacana, which sells a range of products derived from cannabis, from extract oil drops to skin cream.\n\"So much US public policy gets filtered down to the Caribbean,\" she says. \"Because cannabis was classified as a schedule one drug alongside heroin in the US, regulatory bodies across the Caribbean have not been as bullish with [reducing] regulation.\"\nChong adds that the US reducing cannabis to the lower schedule three level, which also includes combined paracetamol-codeine tablets, was \"far more appropriate\".\nThe White House lowering the classification of cannabis may mean that in the future Caribbean nations can export the drug to the US for recreational use.\nHowever, the importation of such cannabis into the US is currently still illegal under federal law. This is despite 24 US states having now legalised the use of the drug recreationally.\nProducers in both Jamaica and Antigua are keen to start legally exporting the drug. Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority says it \"has put in place interim administrative procedures to facilitate the export of ganja by licensees that hold a valid import permit from the country that the product will be exported to\".\nMeanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda's Medicinal Cannabis Authority is working hard to develop a cannabis export industry. \"We already have the legal framework in place, a prime geographical location and an international airport,\" the body's chief executive Regis Burton tells the BBC.\nHe says it's \"highly likely\" that Antigua will eventually be able to export its products, not least for the novelty value. \"Very few people can say they've tried Antiguan cannabis,\" he adds.\nDomestically, high overheads in both Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda – and rules that limit the sale of cannabis to people with medical approval - are said to be leaving most of the market to illegal producers.\nJacana estimates that more than 800,000 people a year in Jamaica use cannabis, of whom half are tourists. But that 90% of the 87 tonnes of the drug consumed per annum comes through illicit channels.\nChong adds that \"over-regulation has strangled the industry. Over time it's got easier, but it's by no means perfect\".\nShe says that due to these problems, she estimates that of the 160-plus licences of various categories granted by Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority between 2017 and 2024, \"very few\" are still in operation.\nIn Antigua, Robert Hill, a consultant to the industry, says: \"It's still more profitable to import cannabis illegally. Unlike dealers, private companies have staff and bills to pay.\"\nCurrently the island has just six cannabis farms, four dispensaries and a cannabis lounge, where people can smoke on the premises. At the same time, Antiguan authorities intercepted 45kg of illegally imported cannabis in just 24 hours back in September.\nMeanwhile, Antigua has been innovative in its approach to domestic illegal growers. Instead of prosecutions, violators were invited to take part in a free six-week course to teach them how to enter the market legally.\n\"Twenty-two have already graduated, with two soon to transition to a medicinal business,\" Burton tells the BBC. \"The industry won't be successful if the illicit market does as it pleases.\"\nThe continuing liberalisation of cannabis across the Caribbean is also said to be having a positive impact on social justice for one community in particular.\nIn 2018, Antigua's Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a formal apology to the country's Rastafarians, for decades of historic persecution, stigma and abuse over their cannabis use. Six years later, the government granted Rastafarians official sacramental authorisation to grow the plants.\nAnd last summer, it announced plans to expunge the criminal records of people previously prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana.\nBut for High Priest Selah, of Antigua's Nyabinghi denomination of Rastafarians, memories of the harassment he and others once suffered still linger.\n\"The police were always coming and locking us up, destroying our plants, tarnishing our name and embarrassing us in public,\" he recalls. Campaigners from his community played a major role in getting the plant decriminalised.\nBack at Pineapple Road, two employees are carefully hand-rolling joints, each one containing a gram of pure marijuana, for sale in the company's dispensary.\nBurton hopes more local growers will get on board and keep the industry's proceeds in Caribbean hands.\nHill agrees. \"We have the ability to compete with much bigger countries thanks to our climate which reduces costs,\" he says, adding: \"We're not trying to create an Amsterdam, this is about wellness.\"\nPrized for its beauty, teak is in short supply, forcing the yacht industry to look for alternatives.\nPort Vale sign experienced striker Andre Gray on an initial deal to the end of the season.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nSir Keir Starmer's visit to China brought agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green tech and finance.\nThe company's revenue was boosted by iPhone sales, but sales of its wearable tech and Mac computers dipped.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Data from Enterprise Nation shows that, in the UK, 62% of Gen Z - those born between 1997 and 2012 - want to start a business.\nThat's reflected in trends seen in data from the British Business Bank's Start Up Loans programme. It shows that the number of loans awarded to Gen Z founders has doubled in the past five years.\nFor the young entrepreneurs at Throxy, it's been a rewarding but gruelling experience.\nRamos declares that there's no nine to five culture at Throxy, rather a \"9-9-6\" ethos of working 9am to 9pm, six days a week.\nAnd Ayerbe adds: \"If I had known the amount of effort and work I needed to do to take the company to this point, I would probably have never started it.\"\nThroxy's founders say one big advantage they have on their side compared with other generations is their familiarity of AI.\nFor Garcia, it felt natural to build an AI-led business.\n\"I was working with early models of Chat GPT on research projects before they were released to the public on research, and it honestly felt like magic.\n\"It felt like there was going to be something transformational here that is going to fundamentally change the way we as humans do work, for the better,\" he says.\nPerhaps one day Ayerbe and his co-founders will be in charge of a company worth more than $1bn (£740m) - known as a unicorn.\nResearch by investment network Antler suggests that the most successful AI start-ups are being founded by increasingly younger entrepreneurs.\nIt analysed 3,512 founders of companies that went on to be worth more than $1bn.\nIt found that the average age of an entrepreneur who founded an AI unicorn fell from 40 in 2020, to 29 in 2024.\nBut when you're running a business in your 20s, it seems hard to avoid your clients and partners, who are usually older, from underestimating you.\nThat's been the experience of Rosie Skuse, who, as a new business owner in her early 20s, was often mistaken for her boss's assistant - and she would have to break the surprising news that she was, in fact, the boss.\n\"Some people wouldn't even shake my hand. It was really tough, and I used to struggle loads with it. It's frustrating when people don't assume it's your company. Then I'd start to speak and people could see I know what I'm talking about,\" recalls London-based Skuse.\n\"Then they'd say, 'wow, you must be so proud - but you're so young'. That shock factor was almost like a secret weapon, because I would catch people off guard, and they would end up actually listening.\"\nNow 29, Skuse is the founder and CEO of Molto Music Group, a music and entertainment agency that counts high end names like The Dorchester, The Savoy, Soho House and Raffles as clients.\nFrom its roster of over 300 musicians, Molto Music Group puts together bespoke house bands for those venues, often designing the stage and set too. It also works with luxury brands like Hermes and Patek Philippe on private events.\nDespite launching in 2019, and the ensuing Covid pandemic causing her early clients to cancel their contracts, business is now strong. Molto Music Group made its first million in 2023, and turned over £1.6m in 2025. It employs seven full-time staff.\n\"I have no business education. It's all been trial by fire and learning as we go,\" says Skuse.\n\"I've had to work a lot on my tone and delivery - and my handshake - but being young and fostering a young company can be a breath of fresh air compared with our competitors. It's more memorable.\"\nBut business founders who've gone before have some words of advice for their younger counterparts.\nLee Broders, 53, started his first business at 26, in IT, after serving 10 years in the military. He's been a serial entrepreneur since and now runs seven ventures, ranging from business mentoring to photography.\nAccording to Broders, making your first million isn't the be all and end all - it's scaling a business to last into the future.\n\"Speed can often hide fragile foundations. Growing something quickly doesn't always equal sustainability or robustness,\" notes Mr Broders, who is based in Shropshire.\n\"It's great if you're turning over a million pounds, but if it's costing £990,000, and you're actually making £10,000 a year, that's very different.\"\nSarah Skelton is the co-founder and managing director of Flourish, a recruitment firm for the sales industry.\nShe started her first business in 2024 aged 46, and is concerned that founders in their 20s may miss out on valuable leadership and management skills that may be best learned in a traditional work environment.\n\"It's great that in this day and age you can set up a business quite quickly. But I think you have to have lived experiences to be really strong at that leadership piece, which is the quite critical bit here,\" says London-based Ms Skelton.\nShe's the co-founder and managing director of Flourish, a recruitment firm for the sales industry.\n\"Also when you're growing a business, leaning on people in a network is really important. But of course, if you're super young and you're going straight into this, where's your network?\nShe adds: \"My network is 25 years of placing candidates, selling to different businesses, working across different countries.

Some Democrats have already voiced concern that the ties between Trump and TikTok's new investor group could end up limiting what gets shared on the platform.\n\"Americans won't be any better off if a TikTok sale ends up with the company in the hands of Trump cronies backed by foreign funding,\" Democrat Senator Ron Wyden said in December ahead of the deal being finalised.\nMeanwhile Senator Ed Markey reportedly said on Friday Congress should investigate the agreement, citing a \"lack of transparency\" and detail.\nSomething TikTok and those behind its new US joint venture will be keen to avoid is too much disruption - so making users download a new app seems unlikely.\nThe US is believed to be the platform's largest global market, with 200 million users, according to TikTok.\nIt faces growing competition from Instagram and its short form video feature Reels - which parent firm Meta has boosted within its apps used by billions.\nAnd experts and analysts have warned changing TikTok too much or requiring users to move to a new app could put users and advertisers off .\n\"Behind the scenes, TikTok is likely working hard to assure advertisers it will remain business as normal,\" says Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable, a media company and podcast focused on the creator economy.\n\"While the need for users to download a new app seems unlikely, brand partners will want to know that their TikTok strategies won't be disrupted.\"\nTikTok updated its terms of service for US users as the deal closed on Thursday.\nIt says the contract users agree to is now between themselves and the platform's new US entity, TikTok USDS Joint Venture.\nThere are several changes. One new rule says children under the age of 13 cannot use TikTok outside of its specific \"Under 13 Experience\".\nAnother point says the new US entity \"does not endorse any content\" on the platform, nor does it reflect its views.\nUS users who continue to use TikTok from 22 January also must agree to the limitations of generative AI - such as its potential to generate inaccurate, misleading, inappropriate or unlawful content.\n\"By using the platform, including its generative AI-enabled features, you recognise and assume this risk,\" it says.\nExactly what changes US users will see to their TikTok app and feeds, as a result of the deal, remains unclear.\nThe BBC has asked TikTok what will change in its American experience, and when.\nBut we know its recommendation algorithm will be retrained on US user data - sparking concern for some over whether highly personalised content it serves could change.\nEnberg says algorithm tweaks could affect what people see or even create, potentially \"leading to a different look and feel\" for US users.\nDr Kokil Jaidka of the National University of Singapore previously said while the app is \"unlikely to suddenly feel different\" for most, \"changes are plausible\".\nDifferences that do appear to US users are likely to be \"subtle and gradual\" - such as weaker personalisation.\nBut locally-controlled, user-facing features such as TikTok's short videos, influencer culture and livestream shopping may not change, she said.\n\"There is a big incentive here to keep what works,\" social media expert Matt Navarra told the BBC.\nHe said changes to an algorithm can bring \"short-term tuning issues\" such as less reach, repetitive content or random recommendations, and TikTok would want to maintain its algorithm as its \"crown jewel\".\n\"What's important here is you're still using the same app, the same account and broadly the same recommendation engine,\" he said\n\"I think the goal is continuity not reinvention.\"\nUsing a licensed version of TikTok's algorithm to power its US version could also present \"constraints around data access, update frequency, and integration with TikTok's global systems,\" Jaika said.\nBut she said changes could impact the For You feed - which \"learns from massive, cross-regional feedback loops\" to surface relevant content - as well as how videos are ranked and moderated.\nHowever she said many unknowns remain, with much depending \"on how ByteDance tweaks the weaker links - such as data separation, update frequency, and oversight mechanisms - without degrading performance\".\nTikTok meanwhile says the joint venture will be able to make the app compatible with other apps and regions to give US users \"a global experience\".\nIts press release claims US creators will still be discoverable and businesses will be able to maintain global reach.\n\"It's not that the world disappears, more that domestic content could crowd out international content over time,\" Navarra said.\n\"In other words, global content stays - but the balance may suddenly shift.\"\nCapCut and Lemon8 are two other popular apps owned by ByteDance accessed by US users.\nPreviously, it was slightly unclear what the law requiring TikTok's sale or ban in the US could mean for its sister apps and their users.\nBut both \"went dark\" in the US alongside TikTok when the ban briefly took effect in January 2025 .\nTheir future in the US now appears to be secured, with TikTok saying \"safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US\".\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

But US President Donald Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation to take down the app.\nThe main source of contention was the app's powerful algorithm, which dictates the content recommended to users. Now that formula has been licensed to the app's American owners and will be trained only on US data.\nExperts say this will certainly produce changes, but how exactly it affects the 200 million Americans on the app remains unclear.\nFor years Washington has been pressuring TikTok to sell its US operations, citing national security concerns over its Chinese owner ByteDance.\nLawmakers had expressed fears that Beijing could force the firm to hand over US users' data. Both TikTok and ByteDance have consistently denied the claim.\nThe idea of a TikTok ban, first floated by Trump during his first term in 2020, gained momentum under Joe Biden's presidency. In 2024, Biden signed a law demanding that ByteDance sell TikTok or face a ban in the US.\nA legal battle ensued between ByteDance and the US government, and in January last year the app went offline for US users for 12 to 14 hours. That temporary blackout was restored after Trump, then the president-elect, pledged to reverse the ban.\nLast September, Trump announced that he had reached a deal with China to keep the app running in the US.\nAnd in December, binding agreements were signed with American and global investors to operate TikTok's business in the US, according to a memo from its chief executive Shou Zi Chew.\nMore details of this deal were outlined in TikTok's latest announcement.\nUnder the agreement, a new business called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures.\nTrump has weighed in on the deal, writing on social media that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok\".\nThe BBC has contacted the White House and the China's embassy in Washington for comment.\nTikTok says the new joint venture will operate as an independent entity governed by a seven-member, majority-American board of directors.\nAdam Presser, formerly of WarnerMedia, was appointed as the chief executive of the joint venture.\nThere are three managing investors for TikTok's US operations, each holding a 15% stake:\nOracle will be responsible for securing the data of TikTok's American users and oversee the retraining of the app's powerful content recommendation algorithm.\nByteDance will retain a 19.9% stake in the business.\nThe remaining 35.1% of the company is owned by a group of companies including the family office of tech executive Michael Dell - another Trump supporter - and Vastmere Strategic Investments, an affiliate of Susquehanna International Group.\nSusquehanna was co-founded by Trump ally Jeff Yass, whose personal share in TikTok's owner ByteDance was roughly 7% as of last year. Its managing director, Mark Dooley, will also be a member of the new firm's board of directors.\nThe board will also include TikTok's global boss Shou Zi Chew as well as executives from Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX.\nThis question is at the heart of the tussle over TikTok's US operations. Its algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" that has driven the app's huge popularity.\nA former social media executive previously told the BBC that other companies have tried to re-create the algorithm, from Instagram's Reels to YouTube's Shorts, but they're just not as good.\n\"Generally, the one who introduces the technology just knows how to do it better.\"\nByteDance had initially refused to part with its prized formula - a stance backed by the Chinese government. But last September, Beijing's top cybersecurity regulator signalled that Beijing could allow ByteDance to license the algorithm to a US company owner.\nAccording to the deal, the algorithm will be retrained on US user data only, which will be protected to meet American regulations.\nThe algorithm will be \"secured in Oracle's US cloud environment\", TikTok said.\nThe impact of this shift will soon be felt by the millions of American TikTok users.\nExperts say this might mean a slower, lighter app that operates differently from the global version. The algorithm might also not recommend content as successfully as the current platform.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends. Outside the UK?

He is still Amazon's executive chairman after stepping down in 2021 as its chief executive.\nAmazon's satellite venture is called Leo.

Both Sunseeker and Oceanco have described their breaches as unintentional, with Sunseeker citing a lapse in due diligence.\nIt is a well-known problem that Myanmar teak continues to find its way into supply chains, passed off for example as plantation teak from other tropical countries.\nAlternatives to the wood in the yacht industry are gaining traction.\nThey range from thermally-modified woods, to fully synthetic materials, to engineered teak laminates – and while options have been around for years, recent innovations, say the companies and some users, are making them better.\nWhile prosecutions doubtless have an impact, driving the trend to alternatives is the exhaustion of pre-sanctions stockpiles of old-growth timber.\nMeanwhile, plantation teak from younger trees is widely seen by high-end shipyards as inferior, rarely coming in the long, wide, dark-brown boards associated with quality.\nOther natural woods that could serve as teak substitutes often struggle to meet the industry's exacting standards or are limited in supply. Cork is sometimes used, but its appearance doesn't appeal to everyone.\n\"Alternatives to natural teak are very welcome,\" says Walter Kollert, a Portugal-based forestry consultant and member of the steering committee of TEAKNET, a non-profit international teak information network.\n\"We are in danger of losing old-growth teak forests which are part of a valuable ecosystem,\" he says.\nWhile the furniture and housing industries also use old-growth teak, they have generally found it easier to substitute plantation teak than the yachting industry, he adds.\nLast October major luxury yacht maker Sunreef Yachts, based in Poland and Dubai, announced it was transitioning away from teak decking altogether.\n\"Teak is no longer an option anywhere in our range …[and] I believe we are the only ones to do this,\" says Nicolas Lapp, the company's co-founder and chief technical officer.\nThe decision, he says, was driven both by the difficulty of sourcing high quality plantation teak and the company's push for greater sustainability.\nWhen you buy plantation teaks, you have a lot of wood that's just not usable, says Lapp.\nAfter testing alternatives to teak, the company now offers two thermally-modified woods – in which a different natural wood is enhanced through heat to resemble teak – though it is not divulging publicly yet which those products are.\nMeanwhile, some small boat models use a recyclable synthetic deck.\nThe thermally modified woods not only match teak's visual appeal but are easier to clean, and offer better thermal performance – staying cooler in the sun and insulating the cabins below, reducing the need for air conditioning, notes Lapp.\nOne newer, thermally-modified wood product on the market is Tesumo, launched by a company of the same name in late 2021.\nThe operation is small, but business is booming, says Arne Petersen, its managing director, adding it is working to increase output.\nThere have been some examples in the past of thermally-modified wood which haven't been successful which can cloud perceptions of newer materials, but Tesumo is a viable alternative, Petersen argues.\nThe product, made in Germany, emerged from a research project involving the University of Göttingen and Lürssen shipyard – one of the world's most prestigious yacht builders – after it struggled to find a good natural alternative to old-growth teak.\nIt starts with a fast-growing undisclosed African hardwood which is heat-treated and then further processed, including with resin impregnation.\nHigh-profile installations so far include one of the helipads on the Lürssen-built superyacht Dragonfly, reportedly owned by Google co-founder Sergey Bryn, and the complete deck of Boardwalk, another Lürssen-built superyacht linked to US businessman Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team.\nSynthetic alternatives, including plastics, are also evolving. Among the earliest was Flexiteek, a UK-made PVC teak substitute introduced in 2000 and which is widely regarded as the market leader in its category.\nIn late 2024, the company launched its third-generation product.\nIt is easier to clean than real teak, retains its color as teak greys over time, and has improved thermal performance compared to earlier versions says Steve Moore, the company's marketing manager.\nA different approach still is making better use of real teak.\nLaminated teak is an engineered solution in which plantation-grown teak, that would normally be rejected for high-end decking, is thinly sliced and glued together to form a strong, stable material.\n\"You are kind of tricking the eye…[and in the process] using far more of the log,\" says Richard Strauss, CEO of Florida-based Teak Decking Systems.\nThe company fits decks using either plantation teak mostly sourced from India, or a small handful of alternatives it has had good success with. The laminated wood product it uses, Green Teak, comes from Thailand.\nMeanwhile old habits die hard. Strauss notes that plantation teak is still the most popular among his customers.\nLapp of Sunreef says what's really needed is a wider culture shift away from teak altogether.\nCustomers typically start with wanting teak until they learn the problem and that alternatives can offer benefits.\n\"Then we show them… and they realise they can't tell the difference,\" says Lapp.\nHowever, small UK family yacht building business Jeremy Rogers is sticking with teak for now – sourced from older government-managed plantations in Java that it is confident are authentic and harvested sustainably.\nThe firm's past experiments with alternatives mostly fell short, says Jessie Rogers.\n\"The problem for the alternatives is there is nothing quite like real teak,\" she says.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nIn France, traditional restaurants are disappearing – the French blame high costs and the \"Americanisation\" of eating habits.\nSir Keir Starmer's visit to China brought agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green tech and finance.\nThe company's revenue was boosted by iPhone sales, but sales of its wearable tech and Mac computers dipped.\nSince returning to the White House last year, the US president has used tariffs as a key policy tool.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

So that's quite impactful,\" says Gade.\nBoth the UN's top climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the International Energy Agency (IEA), have said that, in addition to deep and rapid emissions cuts, technologies to capture and remove carbon are important tools to help limit global warming.\nMeanwhile, the EU says CCS is necessary to achieve the goal of \"net zero\" emissions by 2050.\nHowever, CCS technology is not without critics, who warn it might discourage efforts to cut CO2 emissions.\nIt's also expensive and some environmental groups argue that emission reductions can be achieved at a lower cost, using more existing technology such as wind power, solar, and electric cars.\n\"I don't mind CCS on those sectors where emissions are truly hard-to-abate or impossible-to-abate,\" says Helene Hagel, head of climate and environmental policy at Greenpeace Denmark.\n\"But there are also places where it makes no sense at all,\" she says.\nHagel argues that we could also be making problems for the future.\n\"If our generation, uses the seabed for storing carbon that we shouldn't have emitted in the first place, then the generations coming after us won't be able to use the seabed to store their emissions.\"\nGlobally, hundreds of CCS initiatives are underway or in development.\nIn Europe, several very large-scale projects are advancing in the North Sea region, particularly in Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and UK.\nBilled as the world's first commercial carbon storage service, last August, Norway's Northern Lights project, began storing CO2 under the seabed off Bergen.\nIn the UK, a number of carbon capture clusters are under development, including Scotland's Acorn Project and the Viking project off Lincolnshire.\nOne reason the North Sea is emerging as a CCS hub, is its oil and gas legacy. After decades of production, the geology of potential storage sites is well explored, says Niels Schovsbo, a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Greenland and Denmark (GEUS).\nThere's also existing offshore infrastructure and technical know-how. That's one reason his firm is among the first-movers, says Gade.\n\"[Nini]'s coming to the end of its lifetime,\" he says.\n\"Instead of dismantling everything, we can actually reuse the facilities, the skills, the competencies we have.\"\nInside a large warehouse on the outskirts of Copenhagen, cases of rock samples are stacked floor to ceiling.\nSchovsbo, opens a box to show me a grainy green slab drilled from the seafloor.\nThe geology in this area of the North Sea is well-suited for CO2 storage, says Schovsbo. The rock has a large number of pores, or small cavities, that can hold the CO2.\nAn almost kilometre thick layer of clay or cap rock will lock away the CO2, just as it trapped oil and gas for millions of years, Schovsbo explains.\n\"It's the same sealing mechanism,\" he says.\nA comparable amount of CO2 can be stored, to the volume of oil and gas that's been extracted, he added, suggesting an operational lifespan for CCS sites of 10 to 30 years.\nFor the region's many offshore workers, carbon storage opens up new opportunities.\n\"A lot of the work we're doing today by maintaining turbines and gas compressors will be shifted to maintaining high pressure pumps that inject the CO2,\"  maintenance manager, Peter Bjerre told the BBC.\nThe Esbjerg local adds, \"Fifty years back, it was fishing we made money off, then going into oil and gas,\" he says.\n\"It is just amazing seeing a future building up here with the green transition here.\"\nPrized for its beauty, teak is in short supply, forcing the yacht industry to look for alternatives.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nClimate change is bringing warmer, wetter winters, which means more frequent flooding.\nLyndon Farnham questions whether \"unrealistic deadlines\" are the right approach.\nEels, roaches, carp and bream were among the species to die at St Ouen's Pond in Jersey last August.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Sweat would coat their shirts after those long, hot days.\n\"It was a lot less efficient back then,\" says Leguee. \"Today, technology has vastly improved the job that we do.\"\nTo keep his farm competitive, Leguee has made several innovations, particularly when it comes to crop spraying.\nWith software and remote cameras attached to his John Deere tractor, he can kill the weeds much more efficiently, a practice every farmer has to do before planting seeds.\n\"It can look down and spray a nozzle when the sensors pick a weed, while we're going around 15 miles an hour,\" Leguee says.\nHe adds that he saves on pesticide spray since the nozzles only turn on when weeds are detected, as opposed to the kind of blanket spraying he used to do.\nThe return-on-investment for adding these new layers to his farm operations are often high, Leguee adds.\n\"There are low-cost solutions that won't be as expensive as new spraying tech, and they could be an app to help you better keep your records, for example,\" he says.\nIt's a lesson that farmers across North America are taking on board.\nA 2024 McKinsey survey found that 57% of North American farmers are likely to try new yield-increasing technologies in the next two years.\nAnother report, from 2022, by the US Department of Agriculture said that while the number of farms in the country is shrinking, the farms that remain are becoming \"tech dense\".\nNorah Lake, the owner and farmer at Vermont's Sweetland Farms, says to get a successful harvest, \"there's a lot of looking forward and then backwards and then forwards and then backwards in crop farming\".\nShe once used Microsoft Excel to plug in the figures for, say, their yields from a recent harvest, or a given year, and see how they compare to years prior.\n\"I'd want to know that if we planted 100 bed feet of broccoli, what did we actually produce?\" she says.\nMore recently, Lake, who grows vegetables such as asparagus, tomatoes and zucchini, as well as pastured meat, has been using software and an app from a company called Tend.\nShe wanted to digitise and streamline those laborious tasks into a piece of tech that she can view on her cellphone or computer.\nNow she can input those harvest numbers into Tend, and the software can give her details, and advice, on how to manage her crop best for the coming harvest.\n\"We can use Tend to calculate the quantity of seed that we need to order based on the row feet of a particular crop that we want to harvest,\" she says.\nThere's no shortage of tech for farmers to choose from.\nSygenta, the argri-tech giant based in Switzerland, offers farmers the software Cropwise, which uses AI and satellite imagery to guide farmers on what to do next with their crops, or alerts them to emergencies.\n\"It can tell the farmer that you need to visit the southeast corner of your field because something is not right about that section, such as a pest outbreak,\" says Feroz Sheikh, chief information office of Syngenta Group. \"And the system also has 20 years of our weather pattern data fed into a machine learning model, so we know exactly what kind of conditions lead to what outcome.\"\nWith that data, farmers can cover their crops before, say, an incoming snap frost that could kill a large portion of their acreage.\nIn Germany, Jean-Pascal Lutze founded NoMaze to give farmers a deeper understanding of how different crops will perform under climate conditions.\nIts software is rolling out this year. \"We did field tests in a variety of environments and then created simulations through our computer model to give clients better insight into, say, how much water to use, how to get the maximum yield,\" he explains.\nThe impact of these technologies might be felt by the consumer, says Heather Darby, an agronomist and soil specialist at the University of Vermont.\nBringing more food to market could translate to lower prices at the register, she says.\n\"When farmers get help to avoid crop failures, that could lead to a more controlled farm environment and a reliable and secure food system,\" says Darby.\nBack in Saskatchewan, Leguee notes younger farmers are turning to technology while older tillers might resist major change.\nHe says that farmers need to be open to change.\n\"After all, when you think about it, some of these farms are multi-million-dollar businesses that are supporting multiple families. We need to embrace technology that works for us.\"\n\"I heard someone say once: 'If you treat farming as a business, it's a great way of life, but if you treat your farming as a way of life, it's a horrible business.'\"\nOne animal tested positive for the virus on the farm in Shropshire.\nHarper Adams University is calling for more government support for agricultural recruitment.\nFarmers want better support to deal with rising production costs and cheaper imports.\nFergal Watson's family farm is among 17.5% of farms which may still face an inheritance tax bill.\nHundreds of miles from Denmark's coast a project is underway to inject CO2 into an old oil field.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Mum and step-mum of four Liz McConnell was about to sit down to work at her Dover home last September. But that's when the sound of a fire alarm cut through her morning.\nShe walked towards it and eventually found smoke billowing out of the tumble dryer. Touching the machine, she realised it was hot and, looking closer, she saw that part of it was on fire.\n\"At that point I called the fire brigade,\" she remembers. They advised her to leave the property immediately. McConnell says the fire developed \"very, very quickly\". While Kent Fire & Rescue Service battled the blaze for hours, the McConnell family home was left partially destroyed.\n\"Had I not have heard [the smoke alarm], I would have just been in there,\" says McConnell. \"They are essential, absolutely essential.\"\nSmoke alarms have been around for many decades. The technology has barely changed in recent years – but is modern life slowly outpacing the capabilities of these life-saving devices?\nDetecting e-bike battery fires, for example, is particularly difficult , since these can unfold suddenly. Some researchers are working on new ways of sensing smoke and fire, perhaps even more quickly than before. But, take note: any certified, working smoke alarm is better than nothing.\n\"People are about 10 times more likely to die in a fire if there isn't a working smoke alarm in the property,\" says Suzanna Amberski, head of customer and building safety at Kent Fire & Rescue Service. Her organisation alone found roughly 6,500 expired smoke alarms in Kent properties between 2022 and 2024.\nAt a national level, a survey by insurer Direct Line published in December suggested that nearly four million UK adults might be living in a home without any smoke alarm at all. In the US, an estimated 16% of households do not have a functioning smoke alarm.\nThere are two main types of smoke alarm tech, says Raman Chagger, principal consultant at BRE, the Building Research Establishment. Ionisation-based systems use a tiny amount of radioactive material to charge, or ionise, particles in the air which flow between two small plates. Should smoke interrupt that flow of charged particles, the alarm goes off.\nOptical-based smoke alarms use light instead. They are slightly better at detecting the large smoke particles created by slow, smouldering fires. When such particles enter a chamber in the device, they scatter light from a small light source, which is then picked up by a photoelectric sensor.\nHeat sensors, often installed in kitchens to avoid false alarms if you simply happen to burn the toast, generally sound when temperatures climb above roughly 50C.\nThe tests used in standards for evaluating smoke alarms were developed back in the 1980s. However, despite changes in building materials since then, smoke alarms remain reliable , says Chagger: \"They still respond to all the main fires we get today.\"\nAnd Chagger has personal experience of tumble dryer fires. Some years ago, a fire alarm went off in his own home – in a room where his tumble dryer was operating. \"I couldn't believe my ears,\" he recalls but, on close inspection, he realised a thin layer of smoke was hovering beneath the ceiling above the machine. Chagger was able to deal with the fire safely and says he recommends putting a smoke alarm in the same room as a tumble dryer.\nBut e-bikes containing lithium-ion batteries are a newer challenge. \"When a battery fails, it doesn't necessarily ignite, it will often produce some off-gases,\" says Stephen Welch, senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh's Fire Research Centre. \"Those off-gases are toxic and flammable. If they accumulate, you can have an explosion risk.\"\nIn experiments, Chagger has documented how lithium-ion battery fires develop. \"It's just incredible,\" he says. \"Nothing's happening, then: outgassing and boom-boom-boom – all these explosions.\"\nSome smoke alarms have been designed to be ultra-sensitive. Aspirating devices, for example, constantly suck in air in order to detect even small quantities of smoke in a room. They are often used in commercial settings, including server rooms packed with expensive computer tech.\n\"A lot of stately homes will have that system,\" says Niki Johnson, fire systems technical adviser for the UK Fire Association, a trade body, and owner of fire detection firm Derventio Fire and Security. \"You could be looking at £3-4,000 just to do a corridor.\" Such installations require substantial pipework, he explains.\nOne of the biggest developments in the fire alarm space in recent years has been the rise of smart tech – wi-fi connected alarms that reach you by phone, for example, if they sense smoke while you are out.\n\"Our internet-connected devices use a proprietary radio system, which links the alarms together,\" says Nick Rutter, co-founder and chief executive of FireAngel. The connected alarms can send push notifications to users' phones via their home internet router.\nHe suggests that the smoke alarm industry has a responsibility to reduce nuisance alarms, which sometimes cause people to deactivate or uninstall the devices – a huge safety risk.\n\"If we're producing technology our customers can't live with, that's our failing,\" he says, explaining that FireAngel alarms have been calibrated to avoid making them overly sensitive, in order to reduce false alarms.\nAnother smoke alarm company, Kidde, has developed a subscription-based service that charges users in the US $5 (£3.71) per month for access to a fire monitoring service linked to the Ring doorbell app. \"Trained agents can request emergency help and alert a customer's emergency contacts in the event of an alarm,\" explains Kidde on its website.\nIsis Wu, its president of global residential fire & safety, adds, \"In the case of a fire, it'll send you an alert and it'll ask you to confirm before you call out the fire department.\"\nThe company also has a smart alarm that avoids alerting users to a low battery during the night, when they are likely to be asleep, since this often results in people disconnecting their alarm and forgetting about it.\nFuture smoke alarms might use very different tech. Researchers have developed an AI-based system that uses machine learning to detect fire in video feeds. The tool can spot fire and smoke in footage from \"any camera\", says Prabodh Panindre at New York University – including CCTV, doorbell cameras and phone cameras.\n\"We monitor the size, shape and growth of the [fire],\" he adds, explaining that this helps to avoid false alarms triggered by pictures of fires, or fires on a TV screen, that happen to be in shot.\nPanindre and colleagues have even attached the detection system to drones, which could help firefighters faced with pinpointing a blaze in a high-rise building: \"These drones can actually go around the building and capture the location of the fire.\"\nHe says the team is now working to commercialise the technology.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nIn France, traditional restaurants are disappearing – the French blame high costs and the \"Americanisation\" of eating habits.\nSir Keir Starmer's visit to China brought agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green tech and finance.\nThe company's revenue was boosted by iPhone sales, but sales of its wearable tech and Mac computers dipped.\nSince returning to the White House last year, the US president has used tariffs as a key policy tool.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

The tech giant says this means that its AI tools can operate more quickly, and also keep private data more secure.\nMicrosoft's Copilot+ laptops also include on-device AI processing.\nBut these are all premium-priced gadgets. In general, not many current devices have that capability. AI requires powerful processing that's beyond the means of standard equipment.\n\"It's long term 'if and when' powerful and efficient AI can run on local devices,\" says Jonathan Evans, director of consultancy company Total Data Centre Solutions.\nThe data centre industry certainly isn't shrinking in terms of demand. But is it getting smaller in other ways?\nData centres are traditionally huge buildings, packed full of powerful computers that carry out a large number of digital tasks in addition to driving AI, ranging from video streaming and online banking, to AI processing and data storage.\nIt's likely that anything you have an online login for uses a data centre somewhere in the world. Big companies own them, smaller ones lease capacity inside them.\nYet a few years ago I heard about a tiny data centre, the size of a washing machine, that was being operated in Devon, UK. In addition to its computing power, the heat it was releasing was warming a public swimming pool.\nThis was the first time I'd encountered a data centre that wasn't a giant warehouse, and I was initially very sceptical about the whole thing.\nSince then I've heard of plenty of other examples. In November 2025, a British couple revealed they were heating their home via a small data centre housed in their garden shed.\nA month later, I had dinner with a university professor who told me he had a GPU – a powerful computer processor used to drive AI – under his desk. And as it churned away, it was also keeping his office warm.\nAt the same time, the tech companies are investing billions of dollars in enormous data centre plants around the world. There are around 100 new ones underway in the UK alone. Data centres are energy hungry, and there are significant concerns about their environmental impact.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls data centres \"AI factories\". The argument in favour of them is that we need them to enable rapidly-evolving AI technology.\nFor a long time, the AI sector insisted that there was an apparently exponential \"scaling\" rule which meant that the more computing power you threw at AI, the better it became – although that seems to have slowed.\nBut I'm increasingly hearing voices in the tech sector who question the rationale that this all has to be housed within remote and massive data centres.\nEvans says there's a case for \"smaller 'edge' data centres near large populations\", which would reduce latency and result in faster response times.\n\"Small is definitely the new big,\" says Mark Bjornsgaard. He was the founder of DeepGreen – the company that made the swimming pool data centre.\nHe thinks every public building should instead house a small data centre, working in a large network with each other where required, and providing heating as a by-product.\n\"London is just one giant data centre that hasn't been built yet,\" he says.\nAmanda Brock, the head of business organisation OpenUK, shares this view.  \"The data centre myth will be a bubble that will burst over time, I think,\" she tells me. Although she didn't want to put a date on it.\nShe thinks derelict buildings and closed shops should be repurposed into small data centres instead.\nSome are looking a little further afield than high streets and cities: space.\n\"Space offers a unique opportunity to rethink data structure, where small, scalable data centres in orbit can deliver efficiency, performance and flexibility,\" says Avi Shabtai, the CEO of Ramon Space, one firm developing the technology.\nBack on terra firma, Brock agrees with Perplexity's Srinivas that fewer data centres will be required, and that she instead thinks \"processing will move to a handheld device, or a set-top box, or a router in your home\".\nThis might also become more likely if it's not only the data centres that are shrinking – but also the AI tools themselves.\nThere's been huge hype around Large Language Models – massive, powerful AI models trained on vast amounts of data, which run the AI chatbots we use to generate content. But we have also become familiar with their tendency to make mistakes.\nIt happens in part because of their incredibly broad remit.\nAs the AI ethics campaigner Ed Newton Rex once put it to me: an AI tool designed to spot signs of cancer does not also need to be able to write song lyrics in the style of Taylor Swift.\nBusinesses increasingly agree, and are opting for bespoke enterprise AI tools instead: more expensive but trained on their own data, which is not then used in the training of other products, and primed to carry out tasks specific to the company.\nThese smaller, private tools tend to perform more accurately, and can require less computing. It is also more likely that it can all be stored on the premises.\n\"I've spoken to multiple people who aren't seeing the benefits of using generic AI tools,\" says Dr Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at machine-learning firm Hugging Face.\n\"We are already seeing a paradigm switch between large models taking huge resources, to smaller models being more bespoke and running more locally and tailored to business uses.\"\nBut would a plethora of small data centres present a headache for national security?\n\"The counter argument here is that small targets have less impact if they are penetrated,\" says Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University, a computer security expert.\n\"Larger centres can be big points of failure, as we've seen recently with huge AWS [Amazon Web Services] centres going down.\"\nThere's also an environmental benefit to a move away from large data centres, adds Luccioni, who says they \"are taking more and more resources\". \"It makes sense to not use them all of the time.\"\nMusk's space exploration company and his AI start-up are merging.\nPrized for its beauty, teak is in short supply, forcing the yacht industry to look for alternatives.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nThe Reddit-like website which launched in late January allows AI bots to speak to each other.\nSocial media has been flooded with fake, AI-generated images and videos. But will the majority of users actually care?\nCopyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking."}

Netflix, meanwhile, has had co-CEOs since 2020.\nTop corporate executives are well rewarded - a report from last year showed that chief executives at the UK's biggest firms are paid, on average, 122 times the salary of the average full-time, UK worker.\nHowever, there are downsides to being in charge.\nAccording to a survey by leadership advisory firm ICEO, 56% of top executives felt burnt out in 2024.\nA co-CEO model divides responsibility, accountability, and, ultimately, the burden between two people.\nLeadership coach Audrey Hametner has observed that co-CEOs can take time out that sole CEOs might otherwise feel they can't do. She recalls a CEO client who had not taken a holiday in five years, but was finally able to have a family holiday once he found a co-CEO partner.\nHametner says it also allows bosses to play to their strengths.\nShe gives the example of a previous client where one co-CEO worked more closely with the marketing and product departments, and the other mainly with finance, government regulatory bodies and legal.\n\"You may have co-CEOs where one is an outgoing and high-level thinker, who may find it more challenging to focus on all the small tasks, and the other CEO is more detail-oriented and loves to speak to the data and the nuances,\" she says.\nSharing the workload may also give the co-CEOs more time with their family. That's something they might be lacking - 60% of CEOs report spending too little time with their family, according to a study by executive search firm Russell Reynolds.\nBegg took three maternity leaves of around six months in the space of five years, returning to work each time in a four-day week capacity.\nSimilarly, Sundberg took two maternity leaves in that period.\nBegg notes that it's unusual for a CEO on both counts.\nSome female CEOs have been public about taking minimal maternity leave, with 71% of women in leadership positions taking less than six months' leave for fear of jeopardising their jobs, according to data from That Works For Me .\nThe same study reveals a 32% drop in women at managerial level after having children.\nBegg credits her co-CEO partnership for not turning her into another statistic.\n\"Without the co-CEO structure, the trade off would have either been too great for the business, or too great for the way that we wanted to have our children and have maternity leave,\" she reflects.\n\"If we hadn't had the co-CEO model, we probably would have felt that we needed to find a new CEO, or even sell the business, which are things that happen to so many female-run businesses because they don't see how it's going to work. Our experience was that this can really work.\"\nIt's been the case for Dhruv Amin and Marcus Lowe, the co-founders and co-CEOs of Anything, a startup focused on \"vibe coding\", which allows anyone to create an app without knowing how to code.\nThanks to the set up, Amin was able to take two paternity leaves of three weeks each in 2024 and 2025.\n\"Marcus has covered for me twice. We've both had times when we're gunning hard for the company, and times we're not. The structure gives us permission to be human without everything falling apart,\" says Amin, who is based in San Francisco.\nIn Finland, Denise Johansson was able to take three weeks away from work when her father died suddenly in 2024. She has been co-CEO and co-founder of payment processing platform Enfuce with Monika Liikamaa since 2016.\n\"It was not only a huge emotional shock, it also came with a lot of unexpected responsibility as I inherited another business at the same time,\" says Johansson, who is based in Mariehamn, in the Åland Islands.\n\"Monika stepped in without hesitation, took on more of the day-to-day load, and created the space I needed to deal with both grief and practical issues.\"\nWith six children between them, Johansson and Liikamaa are also able to take time with family while the other one holds the fort.\n\"If my kids need me, I will be off with them - no question. We coordinate so that key moments for our children are protected, while the company still has a steady hand on the wheel,\" says Johansson.\nYet a co-CEO model has yet to become a mainstream, long-term solution. Salesforce, SAP and Marks and Spencer all appointed co-CEOs in the early 2020s, lasting no more than two years.\nTierney Remick is a Chicago-based vice chairman and co-leader of the global board and CEO practice at business consultancy Korn Ferry.\nShe's observed that co-CEOs tend to work best at independent companies without complex structures, and with two people that have already worked together.\nOtherwise, there can be power struggles, misalignment in vision, and confusion amongst the wider company.\n\"Leaders trying to establish their partnership, as well as drive the business and evolve the strategy - and doing it in a way that doesn't create confusion in the organisation - is usually very difficult if they don't know each other,\" says Remick.\nCo-CEO pairings can also be used as a type of succession planning to see if one will ultimately become the sole, core CEO, she adds.\n\"There's a tremendous amount of succession planning happening at the moment. And there is the reality that the pipeline of 'ready-now' CEOs has decreased over the last several years,\" she says.\n\"So we are seeing boards find different ways to expand the roles and responsibilities of high potential leaders, to see how they accelerate and grow in a market that is creating a lot of change and ambiguity every day.\"\nFor Begg, her co-CEO days came to an end in 2024 when Board Intelligence acquired private equity backers, which became a natural point for Sundberg to stand down. Sundberg remains on the company's advisory board.\nNow Begg is the sole CEO, she acknowledges she has less time to spend with family, so her husband left his job to be more present at home.\nAfter their youngest child started school last September, he set up a consultancy that he works on during school hours.\n\"He carries the load of home and family life. It still probably raises an eyebrow when he's called into a meeting and he says it has to be between 10am and 3pm. They'll be shocked that a man has said that,\" says Begg.\nHundreds of miles from Denmark's coast a project is underway to inject CO2 into an old oil field.\nIndia is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in building up a computer chip industry.\nThe latest generation of entrepreneurs have a head-start with AI but also face familiar challenges.\nA host of technology is on offer to farmers, promising to raise farming yields and lower food prices.\nAI trained to recognise fire is among the latest developments in fire alarm tech.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Excel, owned by Microsoft, is 40-years-old. Among some tech leaders it's seen as, at best, a blocker to smoother digital workflows and AI, at worst, an accident waiting to happen.\nExcel is certainly ubiquitous in the business world. According to research by Acuity Training , two-thirds of office workers use Excel at least once every hour.\nExcel's persistence is partly down to the way it remains embedded in technology education, along with Word and PowerPoint, says Tom Wilkie, chief technology officer of data visualization firm Grafana.\n\"Excel is just a really good tool. If you want to look at a small dataset, try an idea, or make a quick chart for a presentation, there's nothing better for quick and easy analysis,\" he says.\nThe problem is that people and businesses fail to distinguish between data processing and data analysis and visualization, says Prof Mark Whitehorn, emeritus professor of analytics at Dundee University.\n\"There are all these small departments where data comes in, goes into a spreadsheet, is run through macros, and it spits out the other end,\" Whitehorn says.\nA macro can be thought of as a short cut. It automates a series of steps within the spreadsheet, so that those instructions can be done with one click - for example formatting the data in a particular style or making calculations.\nSpreadsheets are often poorly documented and maintained, continues Whitehorn, \"and the guy who wrote the macros has gone and the people in the department don't know how to run them.\"\nMore practically, he says, it means data within an organisation is not centrally controlled. This makes it hard to secure and move data around the organization, or to extract it for broader analysis and to fuel AI.\nThis can result in critically important operations relying on fragile spreadsheets.\nLast year, it emerged that Health New Zealand used an Excel spreadsheet as its \"primary data file\" for managing and analysing its financial performance.\nThis made collection and consolidation of data difficult, led to discrepancies and errors, and made it hard to gain a real time overview.\nIn the UK, the recruitment process for anesthetists was plunged into chaos in 2023 by spreadsheet confusion, while the Afghan data scandal resulted from the sharing of an Excel spreadsheet.\nBut getting teams and individuals off Excel is a challenge.\n\"It's hard for an external vendor or an external tool provider to just provide something for the organization that it could use across all those different teams,\" explains Moutie Wali, director of digital transformation and planning at Canadian telecoms firm Telus.\nHe has overseen a drive to shift hundreds of staff members off Excel and onto a custom planning system.\nThe aim is to smooth data integration and management, increase automation, and to incorporate AI.\nBut people wanted to keep their existing Excel setups and simply download information from the new system, Wali explains. \"I said absolutely not. You have to force it by not allowing the spreadsheet to coexist with your [new] applications.\"\nIn defence of its software, a Microsoft spokesperson says: \"Over four decades, Excel has evolved from a basic spreadsheet into a versatile platform used by everyone.\n\"It is more widely used today than ever before, with monthly usage growing consistently over the past six years, and remains the default tool for data analysis, modelling, and reporting across industries.\"\nIt's not just large organizations that can benefit from rethinking their reliance on Excel. Kate Corden operates a bike fitting business, Hackney Bike Fit, which means managing two data streams – personal information about a customer, such as height, weight, flexibility – and information about the bikes.\nShe is an expert user of Excel, from her days as a business development manager in the corporate world. But, she says, \"It's too easy to lose data. It's easy for data to be altered.\"\nCorden switched to LinkSpace, originally designed as a case management tool, which can be adapted for complex workflows. \"It's just having a complete data management system where you've got everything, instead of having multiple excels, which is going to really help me as I grow.\"\nAnd the potential benefits of dropping Excel can extend beyond easier data management.\nJulian Tanner, a PR executive in London, is also treasurer for a local charity. He switched the charity's accounts from Excel to an online accounting package that extracts information from invoices.\nThe package's built-in AI means it can produce customized reports at the touch of a button.\nIt also meant they could dispense with the services of a book keeper, saving over £6000 a year. \"It was a big expense for a charity,\" says Tanner, \"Which you always try to avoid.\"\nFor bigger enterprises, the benefits include smoother workflows and aggregated, standardized data that can be poured into AI or machine learning systems.\nApart from smoother data integration and faster planning cycles, Wali expects to save C$42m ($30m; £23m) a year by eliminating misaligned capital. Other teams in Telus are now considering following suit.\nBut that means users being prepared to relinquish some control – or at least the illusion of control.\n\"People will say 'well I'm taking my data and I'm doing this,'\" Whitehorn explains. But, \"It isn't your data, it's the company's data.\"\nExcising Excel completely may be unrealistic.

Some of them basically live at the spa.\n\"We'll have fluid that comes up and [then] shower down, or trickle down, onto a component,\" says Jonathan Ballon, chief executive at liquid cooling firm Iceotope. \"Some things will get sprayed.\"\nIn other cases, the industrious gizmos recline in circulating baths of fluid, which ferries away the heat they generate, enabling them to function at very high speeds, known as \"overclocking\".\n\"We have customers that are overclocking at all times because there is zero risk of burning out the server,\" says Mr Ballon. He adds that one client, a hotel chain in the US, is planning to use heat from hotel servers to warm guest rooms, the hotel laundry and swimming pool.\nIn November, a cooling system failure at a data centre in the US sent financial trading tech offline at CME Group, the world's largest exchange operator. The company has since put in place additional cooling capacity to help protect against a repeat of this incident.\nCurrently, demand for data centres is booming, driven partly by the growth of AI technologies. But the huge amounts of energy and water that many of these facilities consume mean that they are increasingly controversial.\nMore than 200 environmental groups in the US recently demanded a moratorium on new data centres in the country. But there are some data centre firms that say they want to reduce their impact.\nThey have another incentive. Data centre computer chips are becoming increasingly powerful. So much so that many in the industry say traditional cooling methods – such as air cooling, where fans constantly blow air over the hottest components – is no longer sufficient for some operations.\nMr Ballon is aware of rising controversy around the construction of energy-devouring data centres. \"Communities are pushing back on these projects,\" he says. \"We require significantly less power and water. We don't have any fans whatsoever – we operate silently.\"\nIceotope says its approach to liquid cooling, which can soothe multiple components in a data centre, not just the processing chips, may reduce cooling-related energy demands by up to 80%.\nThe company's technology uses water to cool down the oil-based fluid that actually interacts with computer tech. But the water remains in a closed loop, so there is no need to continually draw more of it from local supplies.\nI ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, also known as forever chemicals , which are harmful to human health.\nSome liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change.\nTwo-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down.\nIn some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"Vapours can get out of the tank,\" adds Mr Wang. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only.\nSome companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants.\nOver the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy.\nMicrosoft famously sank a tube-like container full of servers into the sea off Orkney, for example. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device.\nLast year, Microsoft confirmed that it had shuttered the project. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Data centres that are more hands-off appear more reliable.\nInitial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. And it required zero water.\nBut in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable.\nThe company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. \"You can think of a liquid cooling maze through the silicon at nanometre scale,\" says Mr Speirs.\nResearchers are coming up with other ideas, too.\nIn July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, published a paper detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around.\n\"Essentially, you are using heat to provide the pumping power,\" says Prof Chen. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. Prof Chen says he hopes to commercialise the technology.\nNew ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company.\nThis is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. In previous research , Dr Luccioni has shown that such technologies eat up lots of energy.\n\"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says.\nReasoning models , which explain their output in multiple steps, are even more demanding, she adds.\nThey use \"hundreds or thousands of times more energy\" than standard chat bots that just answer questions. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume.\nFor Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.\nHundreds of miles from Denmark's coast a project is underway to inject CO2 into an old oil field.\nIndia is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in building up a computer chip industry.\nThe latest generation of entrepreneurs have a head-start with AI but also face familiar challenges.\nA host of technology is on offer to farmers, promising to raise farming yields and lower food prices.\nAI trained to recognise fire is among the latest developments in fire alarm tech.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Experienced workers have to check that it is at the right consistency, and it takes a team of 12 to spread the caramel in five layers that make up the Tunnock's wafer biscuit.\n\"We're making roughly 20 tonnes of caramel a day,\" says Stuart Louden, the firm's engineering and transport manager, and the fifth generation of the Tunnock family to work at the business.\n\"Operators do a lot of caramel testing, just on sight and on feel. So basically, they walk up to the caramel and just give it a squeeze.\"\nOnce made, a conveyor belt takes the caramel down to the floor below, where the spreading team works.\n\"Spreading caramel onto wafers is very, very difficult because it's so sticky,\" says Mr Louden.\nWhile this is a labour intensive part of the Tunnock's operation, most of the rest of the factory is automated.\nThe company has always tried to use the latest technology to help keep up with the competition. Compared with the snack giants like McVitie's or Fox's, Tunnock's is a small player.\n\"We are a small fish in a big pond, and to try and keep up with some of these bigger companies that we are competing against, you've got to have the good machines there to get the output,\" says Mr Louden.\nThey do have machines to spread the caramel, which work at night, but the human workforce is more flexible and takes up less space.\nBetween them, the machines and humans turn out around seven million wafer bars and 4.5 million tea cakes every week.\nRaising output can be a balancing act for the firm, between maintaining their traditions and increasing output.\nFor example, like their caramel production, Tunnock's marshmallow is made under close human supervision.\nMeanwhile, the wrapping of the wafer bar is folded around the product, rather than sealed at the ends. If Tunnock's switched to sealing then the production line could run more quickly.\n\"It's a nice thing. If you give people a caramel wafer, and somebody's not had one for 20 or 30, years, they go, 'I remember having one of these when I was a kid'.\"\nThe makers of a new robot arm for the cake industry are hoping to bridge that gap between speed and tradition.\nCanada's Unifiller, a technology brand of Coperion Group, and a maker of equipment for food production, spent years developing a robot arm, called HIRO.\nIt's designed to decorate cakes and can handle all sorts of toppings, including caramel.\n\"If you can squeeze it through a pastry bag... then it will go through our equipment and the decorating tips,\" says Derek Lanoville, the research and development manager at Coperion.\nBut making equipment for the food industry involves extra challenges - perhaps the biggest being hygiene.\n\"You have to make things easy to take apart, so that people clean them. The bottom line is, if it's not easy to take apart, you don't clean it.\"\nUnifiller developed the tech with Swiss robotics firm Stäubli, which could supply an arm that's easy to clean.\nAnother complication is the variability of food products like cakes.\nOn production lines in most industries components will be the same size, often to within fractions of a millimetre. That's not the case in baking, where the cakes rolling down a line will be different - not by much - but enough, perhaps, to upset a robot.\n\"The cake may not be perfectly centred on the cardboard it's sitting on. It may be a little bit oval, may be a little bit higher or slightly domed. So, our solution has to accommodate that,\" says Mr Lanoville.\nFor Anomarel Ogen, human hands are still essential to the baking process.\nMr Ogen is head baker at The Bread Factory, which is where products for the café chain Gail's are baked.\nTheir bakery in northwest London runs 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, supplying sourdough loaves to Gail's, as well as supermarkets, shops and restaurants.\nIt uses around 16 tonnes of flour to produce up to 40,000 loaves a day, which sounds like a lot but, compared with the giant bakers, is still a medium-sized business.\nMachines mix the dough and divide it into into smaller, loaf-sized quantities.\nThey use a range of flours that are farmed using sustainable methods that prioritise soil health.\nMr Ogen says that means their dough is delicate. We watch one of their workers forming loaves from the dough.\n\"Look at his hands, and look how gentle he actually is with the movement, how little pressure he is actually putting in. That requires years of skill. This is not fully replaceable by machines just yet,\" says Mr Ogen.\nHaving staff in the factory also adds flexibility to the production process. If the recipe is tweaked, they can monitor the impact that has on the dough and change the baking process, if necessary.\n\"You can automate more, but you still need to put in gatekeeping right along the path, to make sure that you can safeguard the process,\" says Mr Ogen.\nIntroducing new tech to a production line is always a balance, says Craig Le Clair, principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, and also the author of Random Acts of Automation: How to Fight Back When Automation Threatens Your Work, Your Life, and Everything You Do.\n\"The key in food as well as other industries is developing a hybrid model that integrates automation without losing the \"soul\" of a handcrafted product, like a decorated cake.\n\"Process transformation must apply automation only to areas that benefit from consistency, speed, and volume, while keeping core value-add elements strictly human,\" he says.\nBack at equipment maker Coperion, Mr Lanoville has plans to develop the robot arm further.\n\"What we're focused on this year is really nailing down our scanning, vision and safety systems, so that our customers can work the way that they work, without the robot being intrusive.\"\nMeanwhile in Glasgow, Mr Louden has plans to upgrade his production line, but much hinges on the financial environment. Cocoa prices have been volatile over the past two years, which has a big impact on his firm.\n\"When it comes to investing another two-and-a-half million pounds in equipment, we just need to wait, because the last couple of years just have not been the right time, and we don't want to put ourselves financially in a position that it could hurt us.\"\nHundreds of miles from Denmark's coast a project is underway to inject CO2 into an old oil field.\nIndia is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in building up a computer chip industry.\nThe latest generation of entrepreneurs have a head-start with AI but also face familiar challenges.\nFood company Cranswick is delivering a language course to its employees at its Sutton Fields site.\nA host of technology is on offer to farmers, promising to raise farming yields and lower food prices.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Two units, each with a capacity of 82.5 megawatts.\nThat's enough to supply around 40,000 homes, in total, via a district heating system. MVV Energie aims to build the system on the site of a coal power plant that is converting to cleaner technologies.\nThe scale of the heat pumps was determined partly by limits on the size of machinery that could be transported through the streets of Mannheim, or potentially via barges along the Rhine. \"We're not sure about that yet,\" says Mr Hack. \"It might come via the river.\"\nOne person well aware of the project is Alexandre de Rougemont, at Everllence (formerly MAN Energy Solutions), another German company that also makes extremely large heat pumps. \"It is a competition, yeah,\" he says. \"We're open about it.\"\nHeat pumps soak up heat from the air, ground or, in these cases, bodies of water. Refrigerants inside the heat pumps evaporate when they are warmed even slightly.\nBy compressing the refrigerant, you boost that heat further. This same process occurs in heat pumps designed to supply single homes, it just happens on a much larger scale in giant heat pumps that serve entire city districts.\nAs towns and cities around the world seek to decarbonise, many are deciding to purchase large heat pumps, which can attach to district heating networks.\nThese networks allow hot water or steam to reach multiple buildings, all connected up with many kilometres of pipe. Ever bigger models of heat pump are emerging to meet demand.\n\"There was a lot of pressure on us to change the heat generation to new sources, especially renewable sources,\" explains Mr Hack as he discusses the decommissioning of coal-fired units at the Mannheim plant. The site is right by the Rhine, already has a hefty electricity grid connection, and is plugged in to the district heating network, so it makes sense to install the heat pumps here, he says.\nHe notes that the technology is possible partly thanks to the availability of very large compressors in the oil and gas industry – where they are used to compress fossil fuels for storage or transportation, for example.\nWork on the Mannheim project is due to start next year. The heat pumps – with a combined capacity of 162MW – are set to become fully operational in the winter of 2028-29. Mr Hack adds that a multi-step filter system will prevent the heat pumps sucking up fish from the river, and that modelling suggests the system will affect the average temperature of the river by less than 0.1C.\nInstallations such as this are not cheap. The Mannheim heat pump setup will cost €200m ($235m; £176m). Mr de Rougemont at Everllence says that, at his company, heat-pump equipment costs roughly €500,000 per megawatt of installed capacity – this does not include the additional cost of buildings, associated infrastructure and so on.\nEverllence is currently working on a project in Aalborg, Denmark that will be even more powerful than the system in Mannheim, with a total capacity of 176MW. It will use smaller modules, however – four 44MW units – and is due to become operational in 2027, when it will supply nearly one third of all heating demand in the town.\nThose 44MW machines are actually the same ones used in a previous project, now fully operational, to the south of Aalborg in Esbjerg. There, they don't run at maximum capacity but rather supply 35MW each.\nLarge hot water storage tanks, each able to hold 200,000 cubic metres of liquid, will give the system added flexibility, adds Mr de Rougemont: \"When the electricity price is high, you stop your heat pump and only provide heat from the storage.\"\nVeronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology says, \"Heat pumps and district heating systems are a great fit.\" Such systems can harvest heat from bodies of water or even wastewater from sewage treatment plants.\nDr Wilk notes that, when you use multiple large heat pumps on a district heating network, you gain flexibility and efficiency. You could run two out of four heat pumps in the autumn, say, when less heat is required than during the depths of winter.\nAll the systems mentioned so far harvest energy from water sources but, less commonly, very large heat pumps can use the air as a heat source, too. Even in a relatively cold city such as Helsinki.\n\"The sea in front of Helsinki is too shallow,\" explains Timo Aaltonen, senior vice president of heating and cooling at Helen Oy, an energy firm. \"We calculated that we would need to build a tunnel more than 20km long to the ocean, to get enough water [with a] temperature high enough.\"\nHelsinki is in the process of radically overhauling its district heating system. The city has added heat pumps, biomass burners and electric boilers to a 1,400km network that links up nearly 90% of buildings in the Finnish capital, adds Mr Aaltonen.\nHeat pumps convert single kilowatt hours of electricity into multiple kilowatt hours of heat but electric boilers can't do this and are therefore considered less efficient.\nI ask why Helen Oy decided to install hundreds of megawatts of these boilers and Mr Aaltonen says that they are cheaper to install than heat pumps and having them also means he and colleagues don't have to rely entirely on the air, which is limited in terms of how much heat it can provide at scale. Plus, the electric boilers can help to soak up surplus renewables and provide an electricity grid-balancing function, he says.\nThere are no heat pumps in the UK that rival the systems under development in Denmark, Germany and Finland. However, some new district heating networks are on the way, such as the Exeter Energy Network, which will supply the University of Exeter and other customers.\nThe minimum planned capacity of the network is 12MW. It will feature three 4MW air-to-water heat pumps, with the first unit due to become operational in 2028.\nKeith Baker at Glasgow Caledonian University, who researches district heating systems, says the UK has opportunities to make more of this technology. Water in disused mines, which maintains a relatively stable temperature, is beginning to supply larger heat pumps here, for example.\nPost-industrial and rural areas where there is adequate space to install heat pumps and heat storage tanks are \"the sweet spots\", he says.\nPrized for its beauty, teak is in short supply, forcing the yacht industry to look for alternatives.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nEast Surrey Hospital, Redhill, received funds from Great British Energy for over 2,800 panels.\nThe body responsible for managing the UK's airspace opposes the project in southern Scotland.\nThe firm wants to create a network of \"orbital data centres\" to power artificial intelligence.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

It doesn't sound much fun.\nThat's what patients at Royal Brompton Hospital in London had to do during certain lung scans, until the hospital installed a new device last year that cut these examinations down to just 15 minutes.\nIt is partly thanks to image processing technology in the scanner but also a special material called cadmium zinc telluride (CZT), which allows the machine to produce highly detailed, 3D images of patients' lungs.\n\"You get beautiful pictures from this scanner,\" says Dr Kshama Wechalekar, head of nuclear medicine and PET. \"It's an amazing feat of engineering and physics.\"\nThe CZT in the machine, which was installed at the hospital last August, was made by Kromek – a British company. Kromek is one of just a few firms in the world that can make CZT. You may never have heard of the stuff but, in Dr Wechalekar's words, it is enabling a \"revolution\" in medical imaging.\nThis wonder material has many other uses, such as in X-ray telescopes, radiation detectors and airport security scanners. And it is increasingly sought-after.\nInvestigations of patients' lungs performed by Dr Wechalekar and her colleagues involve looking for the presence of many tiny blood clots in people with long Covid, or a larger clot known as a pulmonary embolism, for example.\nThe £1m scanner works by detecting gamma rays emitted by a radioactive substance that is injected into patients' bodies.\nBut the scanner's sensitivity means less of this substance is needed than before: \"We can reduce doses about 30%,\" says Dr Wechalekar. While CZT-based scanners are not new in general, large, whole-body scanners such as this one are a relatively recent innovation.\nCZT itself has been around for decades but it is notoriously difficult to manufacture. \"It has taken a long time for it to develop into an industrial-scale production process,\" says Arnab Basu, founding chief executive of Kromek.\nIn the company's facility at Sedgefield, there are 170 small furnaces in a room that Dr Basu describes as looking \"like a server farm\".\nA special powder is heated up in these furnaces, turned molten, and then solidified into a single-crystal structure. The whole process takes weeks. \"Atom by atom, the crystals are rearranged […] so they become all aligned,\" says Dr Basu.\nThe newly formed CZT, a semiconductor, can detect tiny photon particles in X-rays and gamma rays with incredible precision – like a highly specialised version of the light-sensing, silicon-based image sensor in your smartphone camera.\nWhenever a high energy photon strikes the CZT, it mobilises an electron and this electrical signal can be used to make an image. Earlier scanner technology used a two-step process, which was not as precise.\n\"It's digital,\" says Dr Basu. \"It's a single conversion step. It retains all the important information such as timing, the energy of the X-ray that is hitting the CZT detector – you can create colour, or spectroscopic images.\"\nHe adds that CZT-based scanners are currently in use for explosives detection at UK airports, and for scanning checked baggage in some US airports. \"We expect CZT to come into the hand luggage segment over the next [few] years.\"\nBut it's not always easy to get your hands on CZT.\nHenric Krawczynski at Washington University in St Louis in the US has used the material before on space telescopes attached to high altitude balloons. These detectors can pick up X-rays emitted by both neutron stars and plasma around black holes.\nProf Krawczynski wants very thin, 0.8mm pieces of CZT for his telescopes because this helps to reduce the amount of background radiation they pick up, allowing for a clearer signal. \"We'd like to buy 17 new detectors,\" he says. \"It's really difficult to get these thin ones.\"\nHe was unable to source the CZT from Kromek. Dr Basu says his firm has high demand at the moment. \"We support many, many research organisations,\" he adds, \"It's very difficult for us to do a hundred different things. Each research [project] needs a very particular type of detector structure.\"\nFor Prof Krawczynski, it's not a crisis – he says he might use either CZT that he has from previous research, or cadmium telluride, an alternative, for his next mission.\nHowever, there are bigger headaches at the moment. That upcoming mission was due to fly from Antarctica in December but \"all the dates are in flux\", says Prof Krawczynski, because of the US government shutdown .\nMany other scientists use CZT. In the UK, a major upgrade of the Diamond Light Source research facility in Oxfordshire – costing half a billion pounds – will improve its capabilities thanks to the installation of CZT-based detectors.\nDiamond Light Source is a synchrotron, which fires electrons around a giant ring at nearly the speed of light. Magnets cause these whizzing electrons to lose some energy in the form of X-rays, and these are directed off from the ring in beamlines so that they may be used to analyse materials, for example.\nSome recent experiments have involved probing impurities in aluminium while it melts. Understanding those impurities better could help improve recycled forms of the metal.\nWith Diamond Light Source's upgrade, due to complete in 2030, the X-rays produced will be significantly brighter, meaning that existing sensors would not be able to detect them properly.\n\"There's no point in spending all this money in upgrading these facilities if you can't detect the light they produce,\" says Matt Veale, group leader for detector development at the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a stakeholder in the Diamond Light Source.\nThat's why, here too, CZT is the material of choice.\nPrized for its beauty, teak is in short supply, forcing the yacht industry to look for alternatives.\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nThe firm wants to create a network of \"orbital data centres\" to power artificial intelligence.\nAI chatbots are being used as 'surrogate friends' by young people who have lost the ability to socialise.\nGeorge is an avatar on my mobile but claims to know  what makes me tick.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

Maarten Logtenberg wielded a sledgehammer, which simply bounced off the sample, barely leaving a scratch.\nAfter two years of experimentation, the material was finally right: a particular mix of thermoplastics and fibreglass that is strong, has no need of extra coating to protect it from sunlight, and is resistant to fouling and marine growth.\nThe perfect base, says Mr Logtenberg, from which to 3D print a boat.\nBoats need to withstand the unforgiving nature of the marine environment. It's one of the reasons why boatbuilding is a notoriously labour-intensive business.\nBut after months of tweaking the chemistry, it took just four days for the first hull to roll off the printer at the new factory that Mr Logtenberg and his colleagues run.\n\"We're automating almost 90% of the boat-building process, and in superfast time,\" he says.\n\"Normally it takes weeks to build a hull.

[So] instead of just building machines, we're going to do it ourselves.\"\nTraditional fibreglass boat building requires a mould and considerable manual work to make sure the vessel is of the required strength.\nIn additive manufacturing, the work has already been done at the design stage, in creating the software and the printer itself (which is labour intensive).\n3D printers work by building up tiny layers of the basic material, to a predetermined digital design.\nEach layer then bonds to the previous one to allow the creation of a single, seamless object.\nIn the production phase, as long as there is a supply of the base material, there is little or no need for human intervention.\nThe design can also be adjusted without the need for major changes in the build process.\nMuch 3D printing operates on a relatively small scale – dentistry is one area where it has made a major impact. To create a boat capable of operating in real world conditions is a different challenge.\nCEAD's largest 3D printer is nearly 40m (131ft) long, and has been used by a customer in Abu Dhabi to print an electric ferry.\nAnd in the 12 months since they have been operating the Marine Application Centre in Delft, they have already built a prototype 12m fast boat, similar to a RIB, for the Dutch Navy.\n\"Normally when the Navy buys a boat, it takes them years before they receive it and they pay quite some money,\" says Mr Logtenberg.\n\"We did it in six weeks and for a very limited budget. And we can learn from it and build another one in six weeks and even recycle the first one.\"\nAnother fast growth area is the use of unmanned vessels – nautical drones. CEAD recently took part in a test with Nato Special Forces in which drones were built on site in a matter of hours, with designs changing according to operational requirements.\nThe ability to relocate production makes 3D printing incredibly flexible, according to Mr Logtenberg.\nEven a substantial printer can be carried in a shipping container and taken much closer to the end user.\n\"It doesn't matter whether it's a 6m small work boat or a 12m military boat. The machine just takes it all as long as we have the design.\n\"The only transport we need to do is the base material, which comes in big bags and it's very transport efficient, compared to a boat.\"\nNot far from CEAD, in the port city of Rotterdam, a company called Raw Idea and their 'Tanaruz' brand are looking at making a similar impact in the leisure market, especially rentals.\n\"Consumers are hesitant [because of the novelty], but the rental market is really keen,\" says Joyce Pont, Raw Idea's managing director.\n\"It's marketing, you can go to the socials and say, 'we've got a 3D printed boat', and everybody wants to look at and touch that boat.\"\nAnother selling point is that Raw Idea uses a mix of glass fibre and recycled consumer plastics (fizzy drinks bottles and so on).\nThat's one reason why the price is currently comparable to a traditionally-built boat, because recycled material costs more to buy.\nBut Ms Pont says scale and flexibility will bring costs down significantly.\n\"I'm convinced that in five years from now, 3D printed boats will take over the market for the fast-driving boat, like work boats, like speed boats,\" she tells me.\nThe marine industry is intensely regulated but the certification authorities are having to keep pace with innovation.\nBoth RAW Idea and CEAD are engaging with European regulators almost in real time, as they use new materials and new ideas to produce vessels that cannot be compared to what has come before.\n3D printing has often been hailed as a revolutionary technology but hasn't always delivered on those hopes.\nMr Logtenberg says that's because the technique is used in multiple different contexts.\n\"It's all being seen as one thing, but you have metal printing, you have polymer or large-scale printing, all these different applications.\n\"There are many applications that didn't succeed because it was not competitive enough, but there are a few where it actually happened and is being used.\"\nAdditive manufacturing is being used more frequently in the shipping industry, but in technical niches, rather than entire hulls.\nHow far could 3D printing go in the maritime world? We are a long way from entire ships being printed in one go.\nJoyce Pont is sceptical whether that moment will arrive in the foreseeable future – she sees the building of superyachts and other such vessels as a 'craft' which will resist automation.\n\"Building a 12-meter boat, I never expected that a year ago,\" he says.\n\"Traditional shipbuilding is done in modules. It's going to take maybe a decade or two before we are going to completely print [a ship's hull], because there will be more need of material research.\n\"But thermal plastics are being developed and improved all the time. Of course, the machines, everything needs to be scaled up, but why not?\"\nPrecious metal prices hit record highs in January as investors parked their money in \"safe havens\".\nThe firm wants to create a network of \"orbital data centres\" to power artificial intelligence.\nAI chatbots are being used as 'surrogate friends' by young people who have lost the ability to socialise.\nGeorge is an avatar on my mobile but claims to know  what makes me tick.\nIn France, traditional restaurants are disappearing – the French blame high costs and the \"Americanisation\" of eating habits.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

It's often easy to shrug it off, but there's a risk.\nBeing a victim of a data breach increases your chances of being targeted by criminals and scammers.\nSue told the BBC how scammers went after her. We found her details had been leaked online.\nShe was a victim of what's known as a Sim swap attack - where scammers trick a network operator into thinking they're the account holder to get a new Sim card for a mobile device.\nThey used it to take over almost all her online accounts through her phone. She said the experience was \"horrible\".\n\"The scammers took over my Gmail account and then locked me out of my bank accounts because they failed security checks,\" she said.\nSue also had a credit card opened in her name and the criminals purchased more than £3,000 in vouchers.\nIt took several trips to the branches of her bank and mobile phone provider to get her accounts back.\n\"The criminals also did a sinister thing after breaking into my WhatsApp,\" she said. \"They sent messages to horse riding groups I am in warning there were people on their way to stab the horses.\"\nWe searched hacker databases using online tools like haveibeenpwned.com and Constella Intelligence to see if Sue's details were previously compromised.\nHer phone number, email address, date of birth and physical address were all exposed in data breaches at gambling platform PaddyPower in 2010 and email validation tool Verifications.io in 2019. Other compilations of hacked records also included her details.\nHannah Baumgaertner, from cyber firm Silobreaker, said attackers likely used the personal data leaked in previous breaches to conduct the Sim swap attack.\n\"Once they had access to Sue's phone number they were were able to intercept any security codes sent to verify her identity for her Gmail account,\" she said.\nBut scammers aren't always targeting big payouts.\nFran from Brazil told the BBC she found a user had registered to her Netflix account  - and increased her monthly subscription.\n\"I was charged $9.90 (£7.50) on my payment card, even though I hadn't made this purchase,\" she said.\n\"I immediately contacted my family to find out if anyone had added another profile to the account we share, but they all said no.\"\nFran was a victim of a common scam where her Netflix account was hijacked by a freeloader.\nIt's not known exactly how they got into her account and the murky world of cybercrime means it is difficult to pinpoint if a single data breach led to someone being scammed.\nBut we found Fran's email address had been exposed in at least four data breaches including hacks of Internet Archive (2024), Trellov (2024), Descomplica (2021) and Wattpad (2020) according to the website haveibeenpwned.com.\nThe password she used for her Netflix account is not in publicly known databases but might be in others.\n\"There is a huge market for cracked Netflix, Disney and Spotify accounts\", said Alon Gal, co founder of cyber security company Hudson Rock.\n\"It's a low-barrier entry point for cybercrime, turning one company's data leak into widespread, ongoing abuse.\"\nScammers often combine stolen private information with public information.\nLeah, who didn't want to give her real name, runs a small business using Facebook adverts and was recently targeted in a long running scam apparently originating from Vietnam.\n\"I got a phishing email from 'notifications@facebookmail.com' saying that I was due a refund. I clicked on the link and entered my details on the fake Meta page and the scammers were able to take over my business account even though I had 2 factor authentication.\n\"They then posted child sexual abuse videos under my name which got me blocked. I was even barred from using Messenger to complain to Meta.\"\nIn the three days it took Leah to get back her business account back the scammers had run hundreds of pounds of adverts paid for by her. She eventually got the money back.\nAlberto Casares from Constella Intelligence searched hacker databases and found Leah's email address and other details were taken in data breaches at Gravatar (2020) and this year's Qantas (third-party breach).\n\"It looks like the attackers used a common technique of linking up Leah's private stolen email address with her publicly listed business number to launch a targeted phishing attack against the email account.\"\nThey could have done this themselves or used a data broker to pay for a number of potential targets he said.\nMass data breaches are fuelling scams and secondary hacks around the world, with several high profile attacks coming in 2025 alone.\nAccording to Proton Mail's Data Breach Observatory, there have been 794 verified breaches from identifiable sources discovered so far in 2025 with more than 300 million individual records exposed.\n\"Criminals pay premium prices for stolen data because it consistently generates profit through fraud, extortion, and cyberattacks,\" said Eamonn Maguire from the firm.\nAside from notifying customers and regulators about breaches, there are no hard and fast rules on what companies should do for victims.\nOffering free credit monitoring, for example, used to be common.\nLast year, Ticketmaster (which saw 500m people affected by a breach) offered this to some people.\nBut this year fewer firms are doing this. Marks and Spencer and Qantas, for example, have not offered these services to customers.\nCo-op chose to give victims a £10 voucher - if they spent £40 in its shops.\nSome are trying to seek compensation in the courts, with a growing trend of class action lawsuits - though these are notoriously hard to win because it is difficult to prove how individuals have been impacted.\nT-Mobile has begun paying customers affected by a major data breach in 2021 which affected 76m customers.\nThe firm agreed to pay $350m - with payments reportedly ranging from $50 to $300.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun.\nBut it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see.\nThis is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed.\nKnown as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now.\n\"AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on,\" he insists. \"It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions.\"\nBut the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all.\nThe Bank of England has already warned of a \"sudden correction\" in global financial markets, saying \"market valuations appear stretched\" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that \"there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now\".\nAsked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\"\nSo why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed?\nThe AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen.\nIts numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another.\nChipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn.\nThe purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough.\nThe value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US.\nYet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500.\nAnd that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF.\nMr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these \"inflection points\": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. \"Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence.\"\nBut as for the big question - is it a bubble?\nMr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is \"palpably exciting\" progress of services that people and companies are using.\nBut he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry…\n\"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"\nNow, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets.\nWhich brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs.\nThe lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: \"restricted\".\nWhat's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations.\nThe TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips.\nThe CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI.\nHowever Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic.\nA core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software).\nNvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term \"AI factories\" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems.\n(Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.)\nStories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them.\nAs Mr Ellison put it: \"I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!\"\nIt is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending.\nThe terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms.\nThere are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia.\nJust before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded.\nThe firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing.\nFew in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this.\nIn a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough.\"\nHe has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology.\n\"I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies,\" he said.\nBut he also said: \"What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure.\"\nElsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month.\nPlus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days.\nNone of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share.\nWhat we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai.\n\"I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,\" he told me. \"Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\"\nBut I put it to him that truth matters. His response: \"truth matters\".\nNor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it?\nBy 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets.\nI put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower?\n\"I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure.\n\"You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy,\" he adds. \"I think that will have consequences.\"\nYears ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about \"irrational exuberance\".\nIn that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com.\nThrough it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all.\nTake Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion.\nThe same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst.\nPlus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless.\nThat is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nThis is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence.\nBut I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage.\nAnd while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale.\nFor now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm.\nOthers will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Over.\"\nThrough heavy static, barely audible answers crackle over from a crew member, who gradually lists the ship's insurance details, flag state and last port of call – Suez, Egypt.\n\"I think this ship will go up to Russia and get oil,\" says Swedish investigator, Jonatan Tholin.\nThis is the front line of Europe's uneasy standoff with Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\"; a term that commonly refers to hundreds of tankers used to bypass a price cap on Russian oil exports.\nAfter the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy, which Moscow is accused of dodging by shipping oil on aged tankers often with obscure ownership or insurance.\nSome \"shadow\" ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.\nOut on the waves, where freedom of navigation is a golden rule, the ability and appetite of coastal countries to intervene is limited, even though the risk they face is escalating.\nAs the BBC has learned, a growing network of \"shadow\" ships are sailing without a valid national flag, which can render vessels stateless and without proper insurance.\nThat is a troubling trend, given many are practically \"floating rust buckets\", says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann.  If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".\nDriven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.\nThe BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.\nThe head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.\nThe rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.\nWhat's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"\nWe spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.\nJourneying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.\nThe BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.\nTracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.\nOriginally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.\nBack in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.\nBy late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.\nThe tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.\nIn August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.\nThe BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called FMTC Ship Charter LLC , but our emails and our calls went unanswered.\nThe beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.\nOpaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.\nPurged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.\nUnity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.\nBy 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.\nThe tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.\nBack in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm. The following August it was reportedly detained at a Russian port due to technical issues and unpaid wages.\nUnity is just one of hundreds of vessels subject to UK and EU service and port bans as both London and Brussels try to increase pressure on the Kremlin.\nNevertheless, Russian revenues from crude and oil product sales were $13.1bn (£9.95bn) in October alone, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) - although this was down by $2.3bn when compared with the same month a year ago.\nAnalysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds that \"shadow\" tankers, either sanctioned or suspected, account for 62% of shipped Russian crude oil exports, while China and India are by far the biggest customers for crude, followed by Turkey and the European Union itself.\nWhile politicians talk of toughening action , navy and coastguard officers point out that a country's power to act fades the further you go out to sea.\nThe right of innocent passage remains a cornerstone of maritime law, but stateless vessels technically are not entitled to it.\nCountries such as France, Finland and Estonia have detained ships, and they can do so where a crime is suspected, however such drastic controls remain a relatively rare event.\n\"There's a complexity associated with it,\" argues Commodore Ivo Värk. \"With the Russian presence next to our borders, the risk of escalation is too high to do it on a regular basis.\"\nWhen they attempted to intercept a flagless tanker in May, Russia briefly deployed a fighter jet and has \"constantly\" had about two naval vessels in the Gulf of Finland since, says Commodore Värk.\nThe fear of escalation sits alongside broader concerns of commercial retaliation if a more aggressive approach were to be taken.\n\"Every day in the Baltic, there's suspicious activity,\" a Nato official told the BBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Nevertheless, the official added, \"we don't want to be cowboys and jumping on ships. The act of monitoring ships is a deterrent in itself\".\n\"Freedom of navigation is the lifeblood of all of our economies.\"\nBack on the bridge of the Swedish coastguard ship, the radio call with the sanctioned tanker has wrapped up.\n\"Thank you for your co-operation,\" says the officer as the vessel carries on towards Russia.\nThe exchange lasted just over five minutes.\n\"You need to see it in a larger perspective,\" says investigator Jonatan Tholin when I suggest these measures appear less than muscular: \"This information can be used in our maritime surveillance.\"\nBut as Europe steps up checks and watches the waves, Windward's Michelle Wiese Bockmann spies something else: \"You can literally see the international rules-based order crumbling through the sanctions-circumventing tactics of these vessels.\"\nThere is a lot at stake for the environment and on security, she says, and meanwhile \"the dark fleet is getting darker\".\nThe BBC approached Russia's embassy in London for comment. In response, a spokesman said that the West's \"anti-Russian sanctions\" were \"illegitimate\" and \"undermine established principles of global commerce\".\n\"Labelling ships used to export Russian oil as 'shadow fleet' is discriminatory and misleading,\" the embassy said, and instances of invalid flags were typically down to \"easily resolved\" issues such as administrative delays.\nIt was sanctioning countries, the spokesperson said, that had \"heightened\" the risks by \"forcing shipowners and operators to navigate an increasingly fragmented and restrictive regulatory landscape\".\nAdditional reporting by Adrienne Murray, Michael Steininger and Ali Zaidi\nA large amount of oil and tyres is polluting woodland near the A14 and threatening water courses.\nSince returning to the White House last year, the US president has used tariffs as a key policy tool.\nAmid rusting oil pumps and rigs, once affluent Venezuelan oil towns place their hope in US investment.\nInvestors bet the action may open opportunities to tap the country's oil wealth.\nDonald Trump has said that American oil firms will invest billions to produce oil in Venezuela.\nCopyright 2026 BBC.

These systems aim to increase confidence when buying online.\nMore recently, AI-powered shopping agents have begun entering the market too. Daydream, allows users to describe what they are looking for and then recommends options.\nOneOff pulls together looks from celebrities to find similar items, while Phia scans tens of thousands of websites to compare prices and surface early \"size insights.\"\nWhile these tools work at the e-commerce stage, a new UK start-up, Fit Collective, is taking a different approach: trying to prevent the problem earlier in the production process.\nFounder Phoebe Gormley argues AI can potentially fix the sizing before clothes reach the stores.\nThe 31-year-old - who is no data scientist, rather a tailor - previously launched Savile Row's first female tailors, making made-to-measure garments for a range of women.\n\"They would all come in and say, 'high-street sizing is so bad',\" she tells me.\nShe says fashion's current model is a \"downward spiral\" where brands make cheaper garments to offset huge return rates, which leads to unhappy customers and more waste.\nSince launching last year, Fit Collective has raised £3 million in pre-seed funding, reportedly the largest amount ever secured by a solo female founder in the UK.\n\"As far as we know, we are the first solution comparing all the manufacturing data and the commercial data,\" she says.\nPhoebe's new venture uses machine learning to analyse a range of data - including returns, sales figures and customer emails - to really understand why something didn't fit.\nIt then turns this into clear advice for design and production teams, who can adjust patterns, sizing and materials before manufacturing begins.\nHer system may tell a firm, for example, to take a few centimetres off the length of an item of clothing to reduce the number of returns overall. This saves money for the company and time for the consumer.\nWhile many in the industry welcome such tools, some warn technology alone won't fix fashion's sizing problem.\n\"People aren't mannequins, they're unique, and so are their fit preferences,\" says Paul Alger, Director of International Business at the UK Fashion and Textile Association.\nHe warns sizing can be nuanced, with body measurements rarely aligning with a number on a label.\n\"It's very difficult, it's very subjective,\" he says.\n\"Most of us are a different shape and size - around the world people have different body shapes.\"\nAnd then there's the issue of vanity sizing - or \"emotional sizing\" according to Mr Alger - where a brand will deliberately choose to create a more generous fit in the knowledge that a consumer, especially in women's wear, will prefer to shop there.\n\"Once these sizing norms are established in a collection, brands will usually refer back to them each season so they are effectively creating their own brand sizing,\" he says.\nSophie De Salis, sustainability policy adviser at the British Retail Consortium, says retailers are increasingly aware of the issue, from a cost-saving and sustainability perspective.\n\"Smarter sizing tech and AI-driven solutions are key to reducing returns and supporting the industry's sustainability goals. BRC members are working with innovative tech providers to help their customers buy the most suitable size and reduce returns,\" she says.\nWith returns now a board room issue and sustainability pressures mounting, more fashion houses may well consider data-driven design.\nWhile no single solution is likely to solve inconsistent sizing completely, the emergence of tools like Fit Collective, alongside a growing ecosystem of virtual try-ons and size-prediction platforms, suggests the industry is beginning to shift.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

or near - the top of the annual bestseller charts.\nBut this year the world's top military shooter might have a fight on its hands.\nBattlefield 6, which has been a huge hit for rival gaming giant Electronic Arts, has been drawing attention away from its veteran competitor.\nAnd long-time Call of Duty fans have been increasingly vocal over worries about the series losing touch with its roots.\nThe clash of the multiplayer titans comes at an interesting time for the makers of Call of Duty, who've had to issue responses to fan concerns about the series losing its way .\nIt has long offered players the chance to purchase \"operator skins\" that change their character's appearance.\nThey're a frequent source of brand crossovers, and previous designs have been based on stars including footballer Neymar Jr, streamer NickMercs and rapper Nicki Minaj.\nBut when Activision revealed skins based on 90s cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead earlier this year, there was a backlash.\nFans accused the company of trying to mimic Fortnite, the ever-popular multiplayer game famous for its sometimes unlikely crossovers, which have included pop star Sabrina Carpenter and an AI-voiced Darth Vader in 2025 .\nActivision said the feedback from fans \"hit home\" and that it took the complaints about the series losing its identity seriously.\nIt's also being released after parent company Microsoft increased prices of its Game Pass subscription service by 20% , angering many players.\nWhen BBC News sits down with lead producer Natalie Pohorski and senior comms director Stephanie Snowdon, they're keen to talk up Black Ops 7's single-player story campaign.\nThe equivalent mode in Battlefield 6 was considered underwhelming by reviewers, and Call of Duty teams are renowned for their skill in crafting explosive set pieces in their narrative modes.\nBlack Ops-themed installments of the series usually tell Hollywood blockbuster-style stories of secret agents uncovering vast conspiracies.\nBlack Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2012's Black Ops 2, set in 2035 and tells a story involving a global terrorist threat and a murky big tech company.\nNatalie says that the \"Black Ops identity\" allows the developers to explore themes that others can't.\n\"There's a lot of really interesting and timeless ideas... there's endless ways to explore them,\" she says.\n\"And then we ask a lot of questions that could apply to any era - questions of trust, can you believe what you're seeing?\"\nBeing one of the biggest names in gaming also allows Activision to attract some big-name talent to Call of Duty projects.\nFor Black Ops 7, that includes Kiernan Shipka, best known for her role in Netflix's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia.\nKiernan tells BBC News she's aware of Call of Duty's huge profile, and the expectations of its fans.\nShe says being involved was \"honestly more exciting than anything.\"\n\"And I think that when something over time garners such passion from fans, that means you're stepping into something really cool.\n\"The reaction is going to be what the reaction is going to be.\n\"If I let that stuff in, that's not a good thing.\"\nAs someone who played Call of Duty when he was younger, Milo says he's also aware of the standards fans have.\n\"I mean, I hope I don't muck it up for anybody,\" he says.\nAsked whether he thinks players are getting \"fatigued\" with the annual series, he says Black Ops 7 won't disappoint.\n\"I think this one just blows the others out of the water completely in the storytelling and where we go,\" he says.\nBut Call of Duty's campaigns, no matter how well-crafted or explosive they are, aren't the main reason players turn up for the series each year.\nThe game owes its long-running success to the popularity of its multiplayer modes, and the performance of Black Ops 7 will be judged on whether they succeed.\nWhen they're asked if Battlefield's impressive player numbers affect their approach to development, Natalie and Stephanie insist they're only focused on making Black Ops 7 \"the best game it can be\".\nAs for what it offers that Battlefield can't, Stephanie says, without directly comparing the two, that Call of Duty has \"variety and volume\" of experiences to offer.\n\"But more broadly, she says, \"I see games as a way for people to connect, to have fun.\n\"They are certainly responsible for some awesome relationships in my life.\n\"I hope that people continue to forge those connections and bonds and  relationships and there's just more of us playing games together in however many years from now.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -
